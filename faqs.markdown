## What is the My LA2050 Grants Challenge?
</summary>

The My LA2050 Grants Challenge is an open call for ideas to make Los Angeles the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1M will be awarded among ten organizations—two per goal category—to implement their proposals. Each organization will receive a total of $100,000 over one year to support its efforts.

LA2050 will commit to a one-year partnership with the winners—leveraging its resources, assets, and networks to help the projects succeed. Together, the winning organizations, LA2050, and Angelenos will make progress for the region that will change the course of our future.

## I have feedback on the LA2050 goals. How can I share that with you?
</summary>

We want your feedback! Email us at [connect@la2050.org](mailto:connect@la2050.org) with your feedback.

We want Angelenos to see themselves as part of the solutions we need to improve our region. And we want to tap into the expertise of the organizations, agencies, and companies who have great ideas about how to boost engagement on local issues.

## Can I apply more than once?
</summary>

There can be multiple entries from the same organization, as long as the submissions are unique and in different categories. However, we would recommend consolidating your resources, collaborators, and supporters to submit one awesome proposal!

## What are the benefits of applying?
</summary>

Beyond the potential to receive a grant for your work, we believe that applying to the challenge will provide additional benefits including:

* The opportunity to participate in a first-of-its-kind regional effort
* Increased awareness and exposure via our public platform
* Increased understanding of LA’s social impact landscape
* The opportunity to cultivate and build new relationships with peers
* The chance to build a coalition of committed Angelenos and organizations to support important work in LA
* The opportunity to learn how to tell a compelling story about your organization’s impact
* Inspiring the creation of videos, photos, tweets, and pithy messaging to promote your proposal
* Visibility in front of other foundations and potential alternative funding sources. Past challenges have resulted in +$2.25M in grants from outside funders using the LA2050 platform for their grantmaking

## What are some tips for submitting ideas to the My LA2050 Grants Challenge?
</summary>

Collaborate. We are eager to see folks working together to improve Los Angeles.

Think about impact.Be imaginative and audacious. We want to hear your most ambitious ideas – but we also want to know that your project is feasible, implementable, and that it could impact the [LA2050 goals and metrics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://alpha-challenge.la2050.org/about/%23goals&sa=D&ust=1544652127690000) outlined by a community of Angelenos.

Share how your proposal will impact the LA2050 goal you are focusing on. For example, if you’ve chosen the ‘Learn’ category, you might describe how your proposal will improve graduation rates; if you’ve chosen the ‘Connect’ category, you might explain how your proposal will increase voting rates or volunteerism.

Be sure to explain why you think the strategy and methods are the best course of action for impacting the goal and metrics.

Videos can help quickly articulate your project or your organization’s mission. To include a video, use a YouTube URL. If you don’t have a video, be sure to include a high-resolution photo that represents your idea or organization. Photos should be in JPG, or PNG format, at least 570 × 345 pixels. You’ll get the best results if you send us the highest resolution image you have. We suggest limiting attachment files to 5 MB each. We recommend avoiding a lot of text or logos in your images, as we may have to crop them to fit our site.

Please note that when uploading documents, file names containing special characters (!@#$%^&\*()) are not permitted; file names should be less than or equal to 30 characters.

Applicants should not expect to be able to revise their applications after the submission date.

Your application goes through a moderation process, and will show up on the site if it is approved. If we have questions about your application, we will be in touch.

## Why do I need to sign in with phone, email, or Facebook in order to vote?
</summary>

The short answer: we want to make sure you’re not a bot. We’re asking for this information for authentication purposes and to ensure that we are not receiving multiple voting forms from one individual.

## I clicked on the link sent to my email (or entered the code sent to my phone) and received an error message. What should I do?
</summary>

You may have encountered this error message because you switched devices. It’s important that you complete the voting process on the same device that you started it on. Go back to your original device, and try again! 

It’s also possible that the link or code has expired. If this is the case, you should be able to resend the code or email in order to confirm your votes.
