title: The Editorialist LA
project_description: >-
  I have already established a successful business with an audience of more than
  100,000 people across all my blog and social channels. Going forward, I need
  support to expand, hire employees, and relaunch the website to focus even more
  on Los Angeles and our local businesses. I would also use this support to
  create a web series focused on Los Angeles, with each episode exploring a new
  neighborhood, business, restaurant, activity, local figurehead, social
  service, and more.

  I believe LA boasts incredible untapped potential for content, so I launched
  my media company, The Editorialist LA, to provide curated content about Los
  Angeles to millennials, especially women.
project_proposal_description: >-
  I've always heard that Los Angeles is a “superficial” city—one that is “devoid
  of all culture,” existing solely for the rich, famous inhabitants and those
  vying to become them. Visitors flock to LA from all over, in search of a
  grandiose sense of glitz and glamour that left town a long time ago and maybe
  only ever existed on film. But that’s the problem with calling something
  superficial; those who do are guilty of the very sin themselves, as they have
  not put in the effort to dive beyond the surface to discover what lies
  beneath.
   
   In reality, LA has a deep, grounding culture that lives beneath that shiny surface. It's the lifeblood of the city, flowing through LA’s streets, crashing on our sandy shores, seeping out of the cracks in the sidewalk, expanding outward into the suburban sprawl. Our culture is a mishmash of moving parts. It is simultaneously elusive but still easily identifiable and strangely palpable, as if it lives in the rays of the sun or the cool ocean breeze. As full of contradictions and complexities as the inhabitants of the city themselves. And it is a culture that I strongly felt growing up in the Valley. This culture was the connective thread to my parents’ childhood neighborhoods. To my grandfather’s time at USC and his offices in Hollywood. To my Great Aunt’s boutique in Beverly Hills and her meetings at Canter’s Deli. To the homes in West LA where my parents lived when they met volunteering for the local City of Hope chapter. This culture has not just been the lifeblood of the city, but it runs through my blood as well.
   
   In 2014, I returned after earning my degree at Washington University in St. Louis to find a city that had transformed. Once classified as a black hole where culture goes to die, Los Angeles had gained acclaim as a food, fashion, and creative oasis. We now had a thriving and well-respected restaurant scene with some of the best up-and-coming chefs in the world, and an equally thriving art, fashion, culture, and start-up scene. This culture had always been there, but now it was out in the open, and others were finally starting to see it too. I believed the city boasted incredible untapped potential for content, so I launched my media company, The Editorialist LA.

project_measure: >-
  I will define and measure success by both qualitative and quantitative
  measures. The first is a qualitative measure of content; once we are able to
  redesign and relaunch the company, I will measure our success by the quality
  of the content we are now creating. Neighborhood guides, restaurant reviews,
  travel guides, video content, photo content, social media content will all
  need to improve. Second, I will define and measure success by a few
  quantitative metrics. The first is content output-- namely, how much more
  local content are we creating with the addition of new employees, freelance
  writers, editors, etc? I will be setting goals to create consistent content in
  the categories I defined above (and more), and how much of that content I
  should be producing per day, week, month, etc. Second, I will define and
  measure success by our audience metrics. I will take a look at our web and
  social data to see how the content is performing, how many more audience
  members we are acquiring, if our newsletter is expanding, how many more social
  media followers we've gained, etc.

  If I receive this grant, I plan to drastically expand my content offerings,
  site capability, and company as a whole. First, I would redesign, rebrand, and
  relaunch my website and social media channels to be more LA-centric. The brand
  message will be clear; we are a local media company for millennials, and the
  one-stop-shop for all things Los Angeles culture. Next, I would hire some
  much-needed help from a Creative Director or Content Manager who can run the
  social media channels, and create more Los Angeles content, like neighborhood
  guides, local business features, and more. Additionally, I’m already looking
  into working with a large media company to produce a web series about Los
  Angeles, where I host guided neighborhood tours, restaurant visits, sit-downs
  with local business owners, and more. Currently, there are few people creating
  consistent video content about Los Angeles as a city, and I believe bringing a
  personal, human perspective would fill a much-needed gap in the local media
  space. Finally, I would launch an e-commerce platform to sell LA-made goods,
  as well as a reservation system to book restaurants, activities, and
  experiences while reading about them. My intent, through capturing a larger
  audience and creating more content, is to create a go-to media source for
  millennials encompassing everything they could possibly want to know about Los
  Angeles, but in a way that is enjoyable, palatable, and easily digestible. 
   
   The population being served by this project is mostly targeted at millennials, especially young women. But really, this project is for all Angelenos. Los Angeles natives, tourists, or people from all over who have moved here in the hopes of pursuing their dreams. I want to explore all this city has to offer, from the hottest new bars for 20-somethings to the hole-in-the-wall taco shops to new restaurants that families and people of all ages can enjoy. 
   
   Los Angeles is a city full of so much potential, but one of the hardest adjustments for residents to make is connection. Connecting to each other and the city itself. Sifting through information about the city is like trying to find a needle in a haystack that is over 500 square miles large. There are already so many cultural events to attend, local businesses to support, and things to do, and there are even more media sources that list out thousands of pages of overwhelming information. It's hard to not become paralyzed by the sheer amount of choices. But I want to make that information not just more readily available, but more easily packaged for a younger audience with a smaller attention span, and with a recognizable face that audiences can connect to. The goal is to create ONE go-to source of information that is highly curated, personal, and up-to-date, allowing Angelenos to finally cut through all the noise and find what they're looking for: things to do, ways to connect, how to support local businesses and restaurants, etc.
