project_description: >-
  We are currently developing Novelly, a reading app that doubles as civic
  education for young people. We use relatable and engaging young adult novels
  as a starting point for discussion and action with young people around some of
  the most challenging and pressing issues affecting them and their communities.
  Over the next year, we will partner with schools, libraries and youth-serving
  organizations in order to pilot the app with 5,000 young people across Los
  Angeles County.

  Novelly is on a mission to spark the changemaker in every young person, one
  young adult novel at a time.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Since 2015, our Founder and CEO, Anna Gabriella Casalme, has been captivated
  by a simple idea: reading stories sparks empathy and critical thinking among
  youth with regards to complex issues. This, combined with spaces for dialogue
  and action, can spark social change. This is rooted in her undergraduate
  honors thesis, which found that Wonder by RJ Palacio can generate thoughtful
  and critical discussions on disability among middle school students in the
  Greater Los Angeles Area. In her work with schools, she noticed how fiction
  can make it easier for us as a society to talk about tough topics with young
  people, giving her immense hope. She wondered how she could find a way to have
  these conversations with thousands of young people. Now, four years later,
  Novelly is building an app, so that any young person with access to the
  internet can also access virtually unlimited opportunities for civic education
  and civic engagement from their phones.

  We will be piloting the web app with students in schools in libraries during
  the fall and spring semester of 2019-2020 school year in the Greater Los
  Angeles Area. By the end of this grant period, we are successful if we achieve
  the following milestones: (1) pilot the web app with 5,000 adolescents, (2)
  collect data from the pilot on the efficacy of the web app, (3) refine the web
  app and integrate new features based on the pilot, and (3) launch the web app
  so that any young person can access it. We are also successful if the data
  from the pilot shows that students who use the web app over the course of the
  semester demonstrate improvements in their skills, knowledge, and motivation
  as they relate to civic engagement. Based on the UNESCO framework for global
  citizenship education, we will measure progress in the following global
  citizenship competencies for students ages 13-15: (1) empathy (2) critical
  thinking/problem solving (3) ability to communicate and collaborate with
  others (4) conflict resolution (5) sense of security and identity (6) shared
  universal values (7) respect for diversity/intercultural understanding and (8)
  recognition of global and local issues as well as their interconnectedness.
  User engagement with the app will be measured by the number of daily active
  users, retention rate, and contribution rate. User engagement with the issue
  will be measured by the rate at which users: complete the novel, complete
  embedded learning activities, participate in discussions, engage with partner
  content, and complete calls to action.

  Novelly is a free web app that provides civic education directly to young
  people. It is a pipeline to genuine civic engagement that young people can
  participate in at their own pace, on their own terms and on their mobile
  phones and computers. The Novelly app catalyzes the civic engagement process
  for youth through the following features: 
   
   
   
   *Read a young adult fiction story that touches on a social issue
   
   *Complete embedded learning activities critically engaging with the story from the lens of the issue
   
   *Participate in community discussions
   
   *Respond to calls to action from partners
   
   *Organize in-person with their peers
   
   
   
   Every quarter, the stories and issue themes available on the app will change, ensuring that our young users will always have access to dynamic content and community. 
   
   
   
   First, we will partner with authors, publishers, and other content creators to produce original stories for the Novelly platform or make existing published content temporarily available for that quarter. This content will reflect a diverse range of backgrounds, perspectives, and issues. Second, we will partner with existing non-profit organizations, initiatives, and influencers whose work is related to the quarterly theme to share calls to action, co-create educational content and moderate discussions on the app. 
   
   
   
   By bringing these partners with a vested interest in an issue and in youth together in a single platform, Novelly can create a unique civic education experience for young people. By starting with entertainment, Novelly can first connect social issues to young people's lives and communities, then connect them to a community of peers and opportunities to take action. Through the app, users can do all of this without gatekeepers, daily and over a sustained period of time. 
   
   
   
   Over the course of the 2019-2020 academic year, we will pilot the app with 5,000 young adolescents ages 13 to 15 in Los Angeles County. 
   
   
   
   As young people who grew up in Los Angeles, we remember hanging out at the school library or spending summers in the local library. We remember how books inspired lively and deep conversations when we were kids. We believe that technology can amplify the power of reading to connect young people to each other, their communities and issues that they care about. According to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, adolescents in California who are civically engaged (have high civic efficacy, are involved in social impact clubs or organizations, and volunteer) are more likely to have better health, better grades and greater motivation to attend college. Beyond the benefits of civic engagement to individual young people, there is the far-reaching and long-term positive impact on the vibrancy of communities. 
   
   
   
   The Novelly app will make LA the best place to CONNECT by increasing rates of volunteerism among young people, increasing attendance at public and open streets gatherings, and increasing the total number of connections that Angelenos have.
