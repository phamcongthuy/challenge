title: Monochrome- Police work is...
project_description: >-
  I am creating a teaching tool using film production to capture the attention
  of those most impacted by use of force and police brutality. To appeal to our
  youth who are bombarded by quick highly entertaining clips we need to use this
  powerful medium to effect change.

  To bridge the divide between law enforcement and the communities they serve.
  We will use the magic of film incorporated into community engagement meetings
  to make conversations more productive.

  I watched a video in 2016 of Anthony Castile's girlfriend and her 4yr old
  daughter in the back of the police car after he was killed by police. At 4yrs
  old she was composed she was trying to comfort her mom. And she said "I wish
  this town was safer, I don't want it to be like this anymore." Since then I
  have not stopped trying to find a way to make that come true for her. I truly
  believe this is the best way to do it. But I need your help.

  Success for me would be every division of LASD and LAPD hosting an event for
  their neighborhood community. This video would be shown followed by Q & A with
  the community and officers. At the end everyone walks away thinking "wow I
  never thought about it that way before." Then the next time they have to
  interact with each other it is with a new found mutual respect and less people
  are killed or brutalized.

  1) Meet with community leaders on both sides of the issues surrounding law
  enforcement.
   
   2) Create film content to help them convey that message to the other side in a way they have been unable to do effectively.
   
   3) Produce each segment with filming, music and/or animation based on the best way to really bring things into perfect focus.
   
   4) The goal would be to have this entire project on it's feet in 10 months.
