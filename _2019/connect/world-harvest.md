title: World Harvest - feeding families
project_description: |-
  Help in reducing the need for food among low income individuals and families.
   
   
   
   Families and individuals are provided with foods such as vegetables and fruits that are essential for a balanced diet, but are costly for low income households.
   
   
   
   Those benefitting from our programs, having access to a balanced meal with fruits, vegetables and cereals, reduced the danger factor of developing high blood pressure or diabetes, among other common ailments related to poor diets.

  Do you need food?
   
   
   
   If you find yourself in the situation that you need immediate food assistance, or are threatened by not having sufficient food supply you or your family's basic needs, World Harvest is here to help you!
   
   
   
   For working families, individuals, veterans, students, or seniors whose financial intake isn't sufficient to cope with daily food requirements, you can receive a cart-full of groceries. This cart-full averages several pounds of food and retails for over $200.
   
   
   
   We request a $40 donation. Your donation helps us cover the costs of food transportation, basic maintenance and management service for World Harvest, allowing us to function and make available our food items to you. If you are unable to donate, you may also donate your time as a volunteer for one part time day of 4 hours.
   
   
   
   There is no Shame in Receiving Help
   
   
   
   There is absolutely nothing wrong or embarrassing about benefiting from services such as ours. More importantly by coming forth and receiving food, instead of you and your family bearing hunger and missing meals, you may enjoy basic staples such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and grain (bread, pasta, rice, etc.) daily. 
   
   
   
   Many Who Care About You
   
   
   
   World Harvest receives many forms of help and support with our mission to provide food to needy individuals and families in times of need. You and your family are the final recipients of this chain of help.
   
   
   
   Every time a crate of produce is donated from a chain supermarket, or a shipment of fruits or vegetables arrives to us from a farmer, this is done with the knowledge and understanding that families and individuals in need will benefit from them.
   
   
   
   In times of hardship, when your determination and forbearance are tested, it is good to know that a portion of America's harvest is destined to relieve you in your time of need. World Harvest is one facilitator of this constant flow of aid, and we're here because we care about your well being and your family's.
   
   
   
   No one is turned away
   
   
   
   No hungry person is turned away. World Harvest caters to persons in all positions in life, all classes, all races, all religions, all ethnicity.

  Social supermarket World Harvest provides high quality foods and non-food
  essentials to Los Angeles families, regardless of income. Operating almost
  entirely without grant funding, World Harvest social supermarket has a proven
  capacity for managing complex projects. In addition to serving 50,000 clients
  annually on a self-sustaining budget, we provide many tons a week of
  high-quality diverted food on demand to clients like reentry transitional
  housing agencies, families on restricted budgets, and individuals who are
  unable to purchase food by offering volunteer hours in exchange for food. Each
  week food is safely transferred into the hands of families in need. With
  LA2050 Challange support more Angelenos will be provided needed food staples
  to enhance their quality of life.
