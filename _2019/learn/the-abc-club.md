  Our mission is to provide high quality literacy resources to enliven
  children's hearts, minds and spirits through fun, interactive adventures that
  provide a strong reading and writing foundation.

  Our organization was created by some of the founding members of Learning
  through an Expanded Arts, Inc. (LEAP)'s Active Learning Leads to Literacy
  program (ALLL). ALLL was in a longitudinal and quantitative study, conducted
  by independent NYU evaluators and showed that students receiving the ALLL
  program outperformed their peers on 87% of the 23 essential literacy skills
  tested. 
   
   
   
   From the time spent working with at-risk students and seeing the gaps in curriculum, differentiated instruction and accommodating for diverse learning styles, we saw the need for a digital program that provides additional support, so with schools we can help overcome these obstacles and provide students with the best possible chance to succeed. In doing research we found that the US literacy rate is at 86%. We need to be at 100%- everyone deserves to be able to read and write. Learning to read and write well can open entire new worlds and opportunities for a child economically and socially. Not only can this impact students on an individual level, but it also can drive the overall progress of the LA community in its growth and abilities to create new sustainable initiatives for generations to come.

    We would love to be able to incentivize the program for students in
    addition- so any partner who would be interested in collaboratively setting
    up a reward program for the students we would be very interested in learning
    more about!

  We will conduct ongoing internal studies of our program internally to assess
  what is driving the best outcomes for students. We will also utilize State

  We will work with 20 of the lowest performing schools in the LA area to
  provide digital interactive literacy programs of games, songs, and interactive
  stories to increase literacy proficiency for students. Many times teachers are
  stretched very thin and despite their highest efforts cannot work with each
  student at their learning level in their learning style. The ABC Club strives
  to close that gap so students have a fun, interactive program that
  incorporates diverse learning styles and allows for students to work at their
  own level so the students who master the activities quickly can move forward
  and continue to learn and so the students who need greater support can spend
  more time with additional games that drive the specific skills so they aren't
  left in the cracks. The program also includes interactive stories that travel
  around the globe so students are given a sense of adventure and autonomy while
  providing early positive associations with different cultures to increase a
  sense of tolerance and celebration of diversity.
   
   
   
   We would implement the program with the LA schools beginning in the 2019/2020 academic year. The program would last the entire academic year and we would use the ECLAS and State tests which are independently administered to determine overall student and program proficiency. Additionally we track student progress internally and work with teachers to target specific areas students can benefit from additional support. 
   
   
   
   Through our platform we seek to provide the students of LA with additional support where they need it in a fun and culturally connected way.
