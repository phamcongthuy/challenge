  Growing up in South Los Angeles, Marcos lived through his youth without
  positive role models other than his resilient mother. He lived through
  financial and emotional burdens, and his future felt hopeless. Those feelings
  changed for Marcos when he walked through the doors of the Club at Carson High
  School his 11th grade year. He was able to begin to dream a life he never
  thought possible. With the guidance of Club staff like Michelle, Marcos began
  an internship with Marathon Petroleum Corporation (formerly Andeavor) and he
  began to apply for college, as well as scholarships to fund his education.
  With encouragement and support from Michelle, Marcos applied for the Gates
  Millennium Scholarship, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. He
  was awarded a full ride to the university of his choice. 
   
   
   
   Today Marcos is proudly in his fourth year of a five-year engineering program at the University of Southern California. This program will award him both an undergraduate and graduate degree in Engineering, May of 2020. Marcos studies Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Management. Marcos says: “College has been more work than I ever imagined and truthfully, the hardest part is not my classes. As the first in my family to go to college, the biggest hurdle for me was simply figuring out how everything works. Lucky for me, Michelle never lets up. She is my guardian angel who never lets me down. I used to think superheroes were only in the movies. Today, my superhero is Michelle. Because of Michelle, the Boys & Girls Club, and my mom, I will no longer be defined by my zip code nor a statistic society has written for me. I am Marcos, community leader and soon to be, an engineer.”

  BGCC’s evaluation process reflects its commitment to continuous quality
  improvement. We regularly measure the effectiveness of our programs and their
  impact on members’ lives. The BGCC will collect data on the following to
  evaluate its programs: (1) Number of youth served; (2) Participation rates;
  (3) Grades; (4) Grade progression; (5) High school graduation rates and (6)
  Improvement in competencies and behaviors, self-esteem, confidence and
  perceptions. Registration forms document enrollment numbers. Sign-in sheets
  and rosters record daily attendance and participation in activities. The BGCC
  uses transcripts, report cards and academic case management files to track
  grades, grade progression and academic progress. The data is compiled and
  reviewed monthly. For youth who stay in the LAUSD school system, the BGCC
  tracks grade progression through its data sharing partnership with LAUSD and
  local schools. The BGCC works closely with the administration of schools to
  receive transcripts. Parents/guardians sign consent forms, allowing schools to
  release their child’s information to the BGCC in order to track academic
  outcomes. Pre/Post-tests measure changes in skills and knowledge. The BGCC
  implements the BGCA National Youth Outcomes Initiative (NYOI). This includes
  the annual National Outcome Survey, which measures improvements in
  self-confidence and self-esteem. The Vice President of Operations meets
  bi-monthly with program staff to evaluate activities and make programmatic
  adjustments. This provides staff with on-going opportunities to discuss best
  practices and address challenges.

  The BGCC serves youth 6-18 years of age at 11 Club locations in Los Angeles
  County. Our Carson locations include the Main Street Clubhouse, Bonita & Towne
  Elementary Schools, Andrew Carnegie, Rancho Dominguez & Stephen White Middle
  Schools, and Carson High School. Our South Los Angeles locations include Edwin
  Markham & John Muir Middle Schools, and Locke & King Drew High Schools. The
  diversity of our communities is reflected in the diversity of our youth: 47%
  Hispanic or Latino, 25% Black, 13% other race, 9% Asian, 4% two or more races,
  1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and 1% White. At least 79% of our youth
  qualify for free or reduced price lunch, while 38% live in single parent
  households. The BGCC works to bridge the gap between school and home for our
  youth who experience poverty and crime in Carson and South Los Angeles. 
   
   
   
   The BGCC COLLEGE & CAREER ACCESS PROGRAM ensures that youth graduate from high school on time with skills to succeed in college and in the workforce. Our outcome-driven programs and caring staff support youth as they take an active role in learning and goal-setting. We provide youth with opportunities to explore careers, enhance their education, and develop leadership skills. The BGCC provides diverse programming that meets the needs of youth and opens up a world of opportunity. Our College & career Access Program includes the following diverse programs:
   
   
   
   The BGCC AIM (Achievement in Middle School) PROGRAM is a one-on-one case management program for youth ages 11-13 that focuses on providing core competencies through intensive academic tutoring, mentoring and experiential learning. AIM is designed to instill confidence in youth as they successfully move into middle school, and again into high school. 
   
   
   
   The BGCC COLLEGE BOUND PROGRAM is a year-round program offering youth ages 6-18 opportunities to participate in workshops, college field trips, and receive one-on-one academic case management. College workshops provide youth with hands-on activities on topics that include paying for college and stress management. Many of our youth step foot on a college campus for the first time because of BGCC college field trips. Youth see first-hand how to get involved in college through sports, clubs, and student leadership groups. BGCC Club alumni provide tours of their own campuses, giving youth a stronger connection to the college experience, and allowing them to see how they can make it through high school and into college. 
   
   
   
   The BGCC WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM runs year-round to provide teens ages 13-18 the resources and opportunities to succeed in the workforce. With one-on-one case management, teens are supported as they build their resumes, apply and interview for jobs, and persist in employment and skill-based internships. Through workshops, certification training, worksite field trips, and the support of strong mentors, teens are empowered to get out into their communities to make confident work and career decisions.
