  CDU is expanding its PK-12th-grade pipeline program initiative to provide
  under-resourced and underserved students kinesthetic instruction in the
  Saturday Science Academy II Program (SSA II). SSA II offers year-round
  opportunities for students and parents linked to the student’s current
  interest in a world setting. Students in the program deepen their
  understanding of Science, Technology, Engineering, Math and Medicine (STEMM),
  as they prepare to be the next generation of STEMM professionals.

  CDU is a private non-profit student-centered University, committed to
  cultivating diverse health professional leaders dedicated to social justice
  and health equity for underserved populations.
project_proposal_description: >-
  CDU has a history inspiring young men and women of color to pursue their
  health career aspirations. Incorporated in 1966 and a product outcome of the
  ’65 Watts Rebellion, CDU was founded as a nonprofit postgraduate medical
  school to meet the medical needs of residents. An estimated one-third of
  minority physicians practicing in LA County are graduates of CDU’s medical
  school or residency training programs. 
   
   
   
   CDU’s inspiration? Dr. Charles R. Drew (1904-1950), an African-American physician/surgeon who overcame long odds and racism. In this tradition, through SSA, CDU’s flagship pipeline program, thousands of youth have become SSA teachers, mentors, health professionals, and SSA parents are continuing the circle of inspiration, enrolling their children and grandchildren. 
   
   
   
   *A Parents Story*
   
   I am considered “first generation” at King/Drew Medical Magnet High School of Medicine and Science. It opened in 1998 and is where I began my journey in what is now called STEM. My four children currently attend SSA II, and they enjoy learning about the human body, science, and math. SSA II has had a major impact on them -- I see the difference it has made in each of them.
   
   
   
   I didn’t have an interest in STEMM until it was introduced to me at King/Drew High School. As students, we would go across the street to Martin Luther King Hospital as part of our curriculum. There, I was assigned to Emergency/Triage (ER), working hands-on with patients and doctors. In 2001, my junior year of high school, I was asked to be an SSA tutor, tutoring 3rd-4th-graders in Biology (also a great interest of mine). The students were very interested as well. Some subjects were fairly new to a lot of us, but being in SSA made you want to go into medicine.
   
   
   
   Though I excelled in track and football, I could not continue playing. My parents wanted me to attend the magnet school and focus on my schooling, rather than sports. Today, I am still somewhat in the medical field serving as a Wildland Firefighter, where I also save lives.
   
   
   
   I took this season off to focus on my children and their education. SSA was the first step. I knew that whenever I had kids, they would come to SSA. SSA II prepares youth for what’s ahead -- educationally, for careers, and life.

   V - Performance Measure: By March 2020, SSA II and MLF will increase opportunities for collaboration among local STEMM academic pipeline and youth sports programs, by organizing a STEMM and Youth Sports collaborative, targeting LA County SPA 6 youth organizations
   
   Success Indicator: By March 2020, Two (2) SPA 6 youth organizations will join the collaborative.
   
   
   
   The core of our program is driven by quantitative assessment data obtained from each student. Students will be evaluated at the beginning of the 8-week Human Anatomy and Physiology STEMM-focused session to gauge their subject content knowledge. Upon completing the eight-week programmatic session, students are given a post-test that is directly aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards curriculum in which they were actively engaged. (Annually, SSA II includes two other 8-week sessions; Marine Biology and Plant Life, Physical Science and Engineering).
   
   
   
   The assessment data is analyzed and used to determine which students may need additional educational support (i.e., weekly tutoring services). Also, the assessment process provides SSA II staff a benchmark of student capacity and knowledge on the subject matter. Qualitative assessments are also conducted using student and parent surveys, student research, and presentations.
