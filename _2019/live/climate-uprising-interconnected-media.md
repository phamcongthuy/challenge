  Climate Uprising is a global call for climate action powered by stories of
  people impacted by the climate crisis and community events.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Climate Uprising began in response to the devastating California wildfires of
  2018, continued denial of climate change, and tepid actions to fight it. Less
  than a month after the Camp Fire, we helped send a group of survivors to
  Washington D.C. to attend a National Town Hall on the Climate Crisis hosted by
  Bernie Sanders on Dec 3. The power of their stories shifted each room, and
  fueled resolve to take action.
   
   
   
   The conversation continues, as we host a Paradise Town Hall on April 27th (with collaboration from the Sunrise Movement) so that more of the 52,000 displaced by the climate-fueled Camp Fire can speak with leaders and experts, and share their stories, needs, and concerns as part of the big picture conversation on solving the climate crisis.
   
   
   
   We intend to give Los Angeles citizens the same platform to hear survivor stories, share stories, learn, and mobilize bold action on climate change.

   2. An exit survey at the town hall assessing engagement in climate change and readiness to take action.
   
   3. Enrollment numbers at Town Hall into our featured ballot initiatives, organizations and climate related volunteer work
   
   4. Community feedback from the Town Hall
   
   5. Quality of work of our trained storytellers, and their continuation of storytelling Social media metrics (followers, engagement, use of hashtag #climateuprising)
   
   6. Metrics of engagement, views and shares of climate stories

  Foundation to connect with the community impacted by the Woolsey fire.
   
   
   
   We are in touch with climate scientists and community leaders to create compelling content for the Town Hall.
   
   
   
   We have helped organize events in the past, and will engage press and media opportunities for this event.
   
   
   
   * The Town Hall services the entire LA community but will primarily focus on lower income Wildfire survivors and Angelenos being impacted by climate consequences (pollution, proximity to oil, fracking, waste facilities etc), which directly impacts under-served communities.

   * We’ll connect concerned and impacted citizens with each other, leaders and experts to move the needle on climate action. We’ll create and proliferate a report based on ideas shared from experts, and questions from the Town Hall participants. We’ll generate powerful stories that are informed by the Town Hall to advocate for change and solutions that are informed by the experts at the Town Hall, and train young activists with the tools of storytelling. We’ll give those with powerful personal stories to share to a platform to communicate truth and spread solutions informed by the data shred by experts at the Town Hall.
