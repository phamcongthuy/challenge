  The Culinary Arts Program will train homeless youth and low-income seniors for
  careers in culinary arts while providing meals for clients at the Los Angeles
  LGBT Center and creating grab-and-go food for the Center’s coffee shop.
  Clients will become service providers as they create and serve nutritious
  meals, gaining pride in their work, confidence from being part of a successful
  team, and pay for up to 300 hours of training, including a 100-hour externship

  Rick is a 24-year-old queer transgender male of color. He grew up in Texas
  where he felt very out of place as a transgender male. His loving family
  suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction. Rick started drinking, doing
  coke, and smoking pot at 13-years-old, as he struggled with being the only out
  queer trans person in his community, never feeling able to just be
  authentically or comfortably himself. In 2015, he moved in with his father,
  who he barely knew because the father was always either away working or in
  prison. This living arrangement did not work out. Soon, Rick moved in with a
  friend and a girlfriend but when those relationships ended, and he lost his
  job, he became homeless. 
   
    
   
   Rick came to the Center, got housing, and joined the employment program. He made many queer friends and found himself in the process. This year, he was offered the LA RISE Internship, which is a 300-hour paid internship which ends in placement in the private sector. He completed the training and got a job as a prep cook at The Border Grill in Downtown LA. He will be one of the first youth the Culinary Arts Program and plans to become a chef. He currently gives back to the community as an Ambassador at the Center. Ambassadors are youth elected by their peers to represent youth and provide feedback on Center programming as well as help implement activities and programming.

  1. Utilizing a commercial-grade teaching kitchen on the Center’s new,
  intergenerational Anita May Rosenstein campus, low-income senior and homeless
  youth participants will complete a 300-hour culinary arts training program
  that leads to employment in the foodservice industry. The 12-week program is
  divided into three four-week modules: (1) developing basic culinary skills;
  (2) preparing and cooking high-volume meal production; and (3) a paid
  externship with a foodservice industry partner (restaurant, caterer, etc.).
  For those who seek employment in the foodservice industry, employment
  counseling and placement assistance will be provided upon completion of the
  program.
   
   
   
   The kitchen will be staffed with an executive chef instructor, an executive sous chef, sous chef, cook, and prep cook. The homeless LGBTQ youth will benefit from relationships with the seniors and staff, as positive interaction with adult role models is critical to their growth and development. For seniors, intergenerational exchange will combat debilitating isolation. Together, they will cook and learn in an atmosphere of camaraderie and mutual support, creating the “found family” relationships so common within the LGBT community.
   
   
   
   In addition to providing training, the Culinary Arts Program will reimagine the culinary experience at the Center. During their training, students will produce up to 560 meals a day served throughout the campus to low-income seniors and homeless youth, as well as items for sale in the Center’s Coffee Shop. Meals will be presented in community dining rooms in an elegant buffet style where culinary trainees serve the food and answer any questions. Center clients will get a pleasant dining experience and the trainees will develop customer service skills and have pride presenting their work. 
   
   
   
   2.) Population served will be 25 homeless youth (approximately 60% LGBT) (age 18 — 24) and 25 low-income LGBT seniors. Also, approximately 60 seniors per weekday will get a nutritious lunch and approximately 130 homeless youth will get nutritious breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week. 
   
   
   
   3. The program will run continuously throughout the year. Cohorts will go through the program in 12 weeks.
   
   
   
   4. The program will help make Los Angeles the best place to LIVE by increasing access to healthy food for up to 350 homeless youth and seniors per day. In addition, the campus will address homelessness by providing 99 units of housing for low-income LGBT seniors (in addition to the Center’s 104-unit Triangle Square LGBT senior affordable housing complex), including 25 who were homeless, and by providing up to 40 emergency housing beds, 60 transitional living program beds, and 25 independent living units for homeless youth. The program will increase self-sufficiency by providing up to 300-hours of paid job training per participant and job placement at the end of the program.
