title: Food waste prevention program
project_description: >-
  Los Angeles Conservation Corps has operated a recycling program for more than
  30 years to reduce consumer waste that goes to landfill. This past year, the
  Corps launched a program to divert edible food surplus from landfill and put
  healthy food on the tables of people in need, as well as sending inedible food
  waste to composting or renewable energy generation. The Corps seeks support
  for the training and employment of at-risk young adults from disadvantaged
  communities to help with collection.

  We provide at-risk young adults with opportunities for success through job
  skills training, education, and work experience emphasizing conservation and
  service projects that benefit the community.

  Thirty years of experience in recycling beverage containers, tires, used motor
  oil, and e-waste taught Los Angeles Conservation Corps how to look for other
  places where waste can be turned into opportunity. We found our chance to do
  our part to mend broken food systems by providing a pick-up and delivery
  solution, so there’s no bottleneck (and waste) waiting for businesses to
  transport their own food donations. We went to MEND to offer assistance with
  logistics. CalRecycle came on board with funding support for trucks and people
  to drive them. Kroger’s distribution center in Compton has an anaerobic
  digester that turns food waste into renewable biogas to fuel their operations.
  LA Compost takes inedible food waste for use in their community gardens. We
  just need a little more help to give at-risk young adults opportunities for
  training and employment while doing their part to serve the community and the
  environment.

  The definition of success is satisfying statewide goals for reducing the
  tonnage of food waste that goes to landfill and increasing the food security
  of people in need in the northeast San Fernando Valley. The measures of
  success would be tonnage of food diverted from landfill, the tonnage of food
  recovered that may be distributed, the numbers of people served, and the
  tonnage of inedible food waste composted or converted to fuel by anaerobic
  digester.

  The Corps collects tons of food waste per week from dozens of supermarkets,
  convenience stores, and restaurants. Edible food is distributed by MEND to
  help feed 30,000 people in need per month in the San Fernando Valley. Inedible
  foodstuffs go to Kroger’s anaerobic digester in Compton for conversion to
  renewable biogas or to LA Compost for use in community gardens. Nothing goes
  to landfill.
   
   
   
   The food waste prevention project serves the needy in San Fernando Valley, centering on the MEND food bank in Pacoima. Los Angeles has the largest food insecure population in America with 1.3 million residents of the County struggling to put food on the table. At MEND, 35% of clients are fully dependent upon the food bank. The residents of Pacoima are 90% Latino. It’s a low-income/disadvantaged community.
   
   
   
   The program was awarded by CalRecycle last year and begins operations this year. It will be an ongoing program, so long as funding is available.
   
   
   
   The program’s metrics include tonnage of food collected from donors and thus diverted from landfill, tonnage of edible food distributed to people in need, number of people served, tonnage of food waste composted or anaerobically digested. Each month, MEND serves 2,540 clients onsite and 18,520 through offsite distribution, and the Corps’ contribution enables service of 10,000 more per month.
