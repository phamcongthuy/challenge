title: Green Together Collaborative - fighting climate change in Pacoima/Sun Valley
project_description: >-
  The Green Together Collaborative received a grant of $23 million from the
  California Strategic Growth Council’s Transformative Climate Communities
  Program to increase the climate resilience of Pacoima and Sun Valley through
  tree planting, solar panel installation, active transportation, and more. We
  seek support for a project coordinator to marshal the efforts of multiple
  agencies and for a resilience center that will serve as the focal point for
  the community’s fight against climate change.

  Pacoima Beautiful’s mission is to empower community members to foster a
  healthy and safe community through environmental education, advocacy, and
  public policy to improve the environment.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Pacoima Beautiful was founded as an environmental justice organization,
  focused on educating the community about health issues and fighting against
  the further proliferation of polluting uses. In 1996, five mothers, distraught
  at the unpleasant sight of trash and toxic smells they endured while walking
  their young children to school, took action. They knew the only way to create
  a safe and clean community for their children and neighbors was through
  collective action, so like good neighbors, they joined forces to bring Pacoima
  some of its first major community clean-ups and tree planting events. The
  beautification projects of our founding mothers set the grassroots foundation
  that our historically women led organization has stood by for the past 22
  years. Today, Pacoima Beautiful is the only environmental justice organization
  in the Northeast San Fernando Valley striving for community improvement.

  The definition of success is satisfying statewide goals for greenhouse gas
  reduction. The measures of success would be energy savings for solar projects,
  metric tons of carbon sequestered by tree planting, and reduction in traffic
  or increase in use of active transportation.

  Green Together will realize the central goal of Transformative Climate
  Communities funding, which is to demonstrate how meaningful community
  engagement coupled with strategic investments can reduce greenhouse gas
  emissions while advancing social equity, economic opportunity, and community
  resilience. Implementation of neighborhood-level transformative climate
  community plans include multiple, coordinated greenhouse gas emissions
  reduction projects that provide local economic, environmental, and health
  benefits to disadvantaged communities.
   
   
   
   The Northeast San Fernando Valley is one of the most environmentally-impacted neighborhoods in the state. This area suffers from numerous environmental hazards including three elevated freeways, industrial uses, and a commercial airport. It is also one of the most vulnerable areas in the City of Los Angeles to climate change with the number of extreme heat days predicted to multiply in the coming decades.
   
   
   
   The timeline will be over five years (2019-2024).
   
   
   
   The metrics for making LA the best place to LIVE include tree canopy cover, exposure to air toxins, and walk/bike/transit score. The Strategic Growth Council will require accounting of greenhouse gas reduction through a range of climate resilience activities including tree planting, energy savings, alternative energy production, and active transportation strategies.
