title: faces of leadership
project_description: >-
  Our social enterprise is ready to scale our game-ified subconscious bias
  experience from game box to cloud. "faces of leadership" helps you visualize
  your subconscious biases in leadership, so you can recalibrate your biases,
  and relate more respectfully and kindly with your colleagues and clients. My
  LA2050 Grant support would enable our local woman-and-minority-owned B-corp to
  take user-tested, coding-ready website wireframes and build the web game to
  offer it to anyone anywhere in LA County.

  Equal Pay Company's mission is to give people the power to grow their practice
  of kindness, inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (Kind IDEA).
project_proposal_description: >-
  Los Angeles is home. In our county, we are 49% Latinx, 26% White, 15% Asian,
  9% Black, 5% Native and Mixed, 51% women, 45% foreign born, 24% obese, 27%
  speak Spanish at home, 23% live with a disability, and 22% live in poverty.
  However, the leaders we are exposed to are not inclusive of these life
  experiences -- at school in all our knowledge sources, on the screen in the
  media we inadvertently and by choice consume, and in our daily life
  experiences. When we all have inclusive, diverse, and accessible archetypes
  for leaders, we can achieve a more equitable, engaged, and thriving home
  community. Our game focuses on making this the norm rather than the exception.
  Ask Teresa, Cheryl, Ross, and any of the folks, who have played, to share how
  they carried their gains into daily practice and leadership decisions.

  Our definition of success is making resilient communities through people
  shining kindness where they have awareness of bias. Our measures of success
  are: 1) completely making the game available on the cloud, 2) playing “faces
  of leadership” with 100,000 residents of Los Angeles County’, which is 1% of
  the population, 3) gathering anonymized population-level data on daily
  practices of Kind IDEA, and 4) quarterly data analysis on how effective and
  ineffective players find the game to be at unearthing and enabling kind action
  against their subconscious bias.

  EPC will deliver this social resilience-through-equity game in three
  sequential phases: 1) coding the web game (June - September), 2) marketing the
  game (June - May), and 3) analyzing data and releasing game software updates
  (October - May; every two to four weeks). Our focus on quality substantive
  content, marketing, and responsive updates are for the target user between
  ages 5 and 25, who reside in Los Angeles County. Their minds are in formative
  years and are representative of the population demographics detailed in the
  story in #8. We will grow anticipation through word of mouth from beta
  testers, sharing their feedback, and crowdraising. With this traction, we will
  host a media preview event and distribute a media release for publication of
  our “faces of leadership” release. This project will make measurable progress
  towards making LA the best place to LIVE by making it fun to know your
  subconscious biases, figure out ways for your kindness to take the wheel, and
  measure those kind actions daily. As a native Angelena, I know LA can be a
  KIND place to LIVE.
