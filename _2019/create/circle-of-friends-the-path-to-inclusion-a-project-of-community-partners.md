title: L'Atelier LA -Experience Fashionclusion
project_description: >-
  L’Atelier LA provides a creative outlet and career exploration for youth
  marginalized by disability or adversity. Inspired by “Project Runway,”
  inclusive teams face challenges like: Expressing yourself and your dreams
  though your look, repurposing material for affordable, ecological fashion, and
  creating adaptive clothing for people of all abilities. L’Atelier will
  culminate with an amazing runway show and documentary planned, designed and
  modeled and filmed by students of all abilities.

  Circle of Friends (CoF) started in 1999 at Santa Monica HS to decrease the
  segregation and isolation of students in Special Education when a parent asked
  teachers to help her son make friends. Through weekly lunches and activities
  for students of with and without disabilities, CoF evolved into a student-led
  movement that builds awareness, acceptance and advocacy for people who behave
  or communicate differently. CoF Alumni kept in touch with their friends beyond
  high school, created inclusion clubs at college, and became successful
  educators, therapists and entrepreneurs. In 2009, CoF added a summer program,
  Circle Summer, to strengthen social skills and independence for high school
  students with disabilities who couldn’t attend camp. They were paired with
  college-age peers in the Santa Monica area, near our original campus.
   
   
   
   Mother Road Studios (MRS), a B-Corp or public benefit corporation, is a fully-inclusive Production Studio that develops art to empower, educate and entertain.
   
   Co-founder, Christina Cannarella, has been an advocate for inclusion for over two decades. She fought to have her son with disabilities attend his home school in LAUSD, Taft HS. In 2004, teachers at Taft developed an inclusive, student-run fashion project. Christina’s son participated, and she created a docuseries of the program. Her experience with the fashion show and filming became the inspiration for MRS.
   
   
   
   We have found that education systems designed to support independent living and workforce development operate in isolation and segregate resources. This is a lost opportunity for students of all abilities to learn and achieve together, preparing them for a more inclusive workforce.
   
    
   
   The US Census Bureau reports that 1 in 5 Americans are living with a disability. Only 47% are employed, compared to 89% of the general population. The Valuable 500 recently launched to identify and promote companies working to address this inequity. 
   
   
   
   Circle of Friends and Mother Road Studios were inspired to link Circle Summer with their inclusive project-based film and fashion program to create a model that will engage students, and break down barriers while building crucial life skills and preparing them for future careers.

  L’Atelier LA’s goals is to change attitudes, model behavior, and promote
  inclusion, positively impacting student development. We will measure progress
  in these goals through the following:
   
   * Pre and post assessment of skills like motivation, self-regulation, and emotional intelligence using instruments developed by CASEL, the Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning.
   
   * Weekly video diaries in which participants will share insights and progress
   
   * Completed project portfolios
   
   * Mock interviews for each project team with volunteers from the industry.
   
   * Audience discussions after the fashion show and subsequent viewings of the documentary to build new multidisciplinary collaboratives and explore future L’Atelier LA projects.

  With project L’Atelier LA, Circle of Friends (“CoF”) and Mother Road Studios
  (“MRS”) will bring 45 students aged 15-22, with and without disabilities,
  together to plan and create an inclusive fashion show. Under the guidance of
  an award-winning Career Technical Education teacher with 15 years’ fashion
  industry experience, participants will collaborate on fashion, from design and
  creation to accessories. In addition, MRS will teach a group of students how
  to document (via film, edit and production) the challenges and personal
  struggles the fashion and event teams face and overcome as they learn and
  create together. Tasks and responsibilities will be tailored to ensure that
  all participants truly contribute, and all projects are organized and led by
  students!
   
   Our program begins with a pencil art project, “What’s Your Gift?” to help students focus on their strengths as they get to know each other. They’ll learn the history of fashion and how it is influenced by culture, power and function. Fieldtrips to the FIDM Museum, local thrift stores, and visits from industry mentors and former students will provide inspiration as students create personal design portfolios. Teams will be given two challenges that require teamwork, communication and problem-solving: using repurposed materials and designing a line of adaptive clothing for people with disabilities. Projects will culminate with a fashion show and the powerful revelations and stories of personal growth and group achievement documented by the MRS team. 
   
   Through this project, students will gain acceptance and appreciation for others’ challenges and talents, while also developing 21st century skills like critical-thinking, collaboration, digital technology, and creativity that will prepare them for future careers in the fashion and film industries. 
   
   L’Atelier LA is a place to CREATE that will help young people realize their unique vision, diversity, and entrepreneurial spirit. Circle of Friends and Mother Road Studios will model a successful collaboration between career tech and special education programs. We will use the documentary to promote a model that can be adapted for communities throughout the city, L’Atelier LA- creating a stronger, more inclusive LA in 2050.
