  My son is an example of someone who needed an opportunity and whose life has
  been impacted by receiving a second chance. After struggling with addiction
  and other issues, my son was able to secure a job supporting a County program
  that helps house the homeless. With my help and experience in human resources,
  I was able to walk him through the process and connect him to services and
  techniques to make sure he was able to secure and retain his employment. Many
  people from vulnerable backgrounds do not have access to this "extra help."
  The applicant portal will not only make them aware of jobs but provide
  services that will allow them to keep a job. 
   
   
   
   In addition, existing websites are not intuitive and do not provide a link to case managers and other wrap-around services. The hiring hub would be designed to provide a resource to community-based organizations that support clients with lived experience, which includes mental illness access to open jobs that they are qualified and vetted to obtain immediately.

  MRS HR has designed a tool that will post and aggregate open jobs that have
  been made available due to Measure H and other legislation. The applicant
  portal will create a one-stop shop for applicants and organizations that
  support job seekers from vulnerable populations. 
   
   
   
   Current recruiting processes and job portals do not fully support recruiting efforts and have led to open jobs, high turnover, low salary models, and depleted applicant pools. There is an opportunity to develop the first ever job portal that will support applicants with lived experience looking to reenter into the community via jobs that have been created through Measure H and other legislation. The ideal Hiring Hub users are applicants ready to stabilize that have been referred by case managers, probation officers, and other program leaders within social service organizations that have prepared and that can support this unique population, which includes applicants with mental illness and other challenges. The job portal will include a database, applicant-tracking system (ATS), and the ability to capture users as they build and manage their profiles on the site. Applicants and providers will need 
   
   
   
   Target: Office of Diversion and Reentry, Community Based Organizations, Applicants (specifically with lived experience and other barriers)
   
   
   
   Desired Outcome: The job portal will collaborate with the current LA County efforts to create the website JobsCombattingHomelessness.org. The new and improved Reentry Job Portal will create a user-friendly, intuitive site that will connect job applicants to current opportunities.
