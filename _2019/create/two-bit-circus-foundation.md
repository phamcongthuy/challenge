title: 'STEAM Lab Makerspace: Pio Pico Public Library at Koreatown/Los Angeles'
project_description: >-
  2BCF is expanding its signature program, STEAM Lab Makerspace (SLM), from
  preK-12 schools to LA City and County public libraries. SLMs are a designated
  space where, using 2BCF upcycled materials and tools, STEAM classes/workshops
  foster technical literacy through interdisciplinary hands-on projects. A
  staple in tech companies, they are a potent source of innovation and
  creativity that, with the introduction of the Pio Pico Library SLM, will now
  be available to the whole community.

  Using manufacturer clean discards, 2BCF provides educators PreK-College
  affordable materials, sample curricula and training to support STEAM
  (STEM+art) MAKER-influenced classroom education.

  2BCF’s story is the story of "from humble beginnings..." Its predecessor,
  T4T.org, was founded in 2004 by manufacturers who recognized that leftover
  materials from their manufacturing company offered creative learning
  experiences at their son's preschool. Through a contract with the Los Angeles
  Unified School District (LAUSD), T4T.org provided classroom arts programming,
  using materials from a variety of manufacturing operations. Over the years,
  the T4T warehouse evolved from a simple "market" into a hub of
  teacher/student/parent creative interaction as T4T continued to develop
  educational programs with the help of prestigious partners such as NASA to
  address emerging classroom needs in science and technology. In 2015, T4T.org’s
  Resource Cart was transformed into what is today 2BCF’s signature program, the
  STEAM Lab Makerspace. A second transformative change occurred when Brent
  Bushnell, Co-Founder and CEO of Two Bit Circus, invited T4T to participate in
  the first STEAM Carnivals in San Pedro and San Francisco. Following the STEAM
  Carnival, Mr. Bushnell joined the T4T.org Board. In 2017, Two Bit Circus
  formed the Two Bit Circus Foundation which merged with T4T.org under T4T’s
  EIN, propelling the new organization into an aggressive new growth phase.
  Today, 2BCF’s STEAM Lab Makerspace can be found in schools throughout So. CA,
  Fresno, and Tennessee with an eye to the rest of the country. STEAM Carnivals
  are thriving locally with three years in Compton and two years in Hawthorne.
  Dallas/Fort Worth is planning year four and our first International SC was
  held in Perth, Australia in 2018. 
   
   
   
   2BCF has completed mergers with two community-based organizations that will remain as Divisions within 2BCF. Imagination Foundation (IF), which grew out of “Caine’s Arcade,” finds, fosters and funds creativity and entrepreneurship in children around the world and LA Makerspace (LAM) with a mission to ensure equitable access to the technical knowledge, digital literacy, and problem-solving skills. 2BCF has now embarked on its newest mission to bring the benefits of its STEAM Lab Makerspace into the community-at-large through the public library system.

  2BCF uses the pre-then-post survey technique for measuring impact, which
  allows us to judge whether the curriculum is effective, serves the students'
  needs, answers their questions, or whether it needs further refinement. Our
  surveys are designed by science coordinators from the Los Angeles Unified
  School District. We will design survey questions for the Pio Pico Makerspace
  program and conduct them at the start and completion of each workshop series.
  Retention in workshops to series completion, and enrollment in additional
  workshops, are also valid measures of impact. We will seek a 60% retention
  rate and aim for enrollment in at least two additional workshops.

  According to US data, over 50% of today's jobs require some degree of
  technology skills, which experts say will increase to 77% in the next decade.
  Yet, LA has the nation's 5th largest job skills gap, primarily in technology.
  For adults who need to stay current, and students preparing for the future,
  innovation is the most important prerequisite. Makerspaces, with their freedom
  to experiment and share skills, have long been innovation hubs in the tech
  community. We now have an opportunity to export Makerspaces to the community
  via the library system.
   
   
   
   With no library Makerspaces available in either the City or County public library system, 2BCF proposes to launch the first dedicated Makerspace in a Los Angeles City public library at the Pio Pico Koreatown Library. With support from LA2050, over 6 months, 3,000 sq. ft. of space would be built out, furnished, equipped with 3D printers, and supplied with 2BCF recycled materials. The Workshop schedule would include such topics as: Open Making Hours, Coding in Minecraft, Intro to Coding for Adults, Circuit Bending Music, Little Makers (2-4 year olds), and Citizen Science. Program effectiveness will be measured by pre-then-post surveys conducted at every workshop series.
   
   
   
   Pio Pico Library is located in Koreatown, fifteen minutes from downtown Los Angeles and near the Koreatown/Western Station metro stop. Its population is 53.5% Latino, with a median household income 45% lower than the city's. The library is surrounded by numerous public and private elementary, middle and high schools. 
   
   
   
   2BCF’s Makerspace division has offered free, family-friendly maker workshops to the public at various Los Angeles Public Library branches since 2014, while training library staff to develop and execute their own maker events.
   
   
   
   Pio Pico's free family Makerspace will support intergenerational and diverse learners, giving multicultural families a welcoming, safe space to explore new technologies and develop their skills and projects. With support of experienced Makers, users will develop important “soft skills” that are key to success in the workplace and entrepreneurship, as well as daily life. Opening access to advanced technologies will encourage users to develop badly-needed STEAM workforce skills and pursue entrepreneurial goals. 
   
   
   
   The Pio Pico Makerspace will: 1) introduce adults to technology in a self-empowering atmosphere with real-world relevance; 2) provide opportunities for students in underserved schools to enhance their creative and critical thinking skills outside of the classroom; and, 3) in the most ethnically diverse city in the nation, allow residents of varied backgrounds to have multi-cultural conversations, fostering understanding on more contentious city-wide issues. But, most important, the Pio Pico Makerspace is a democratization of knowledge, a reaffirmation of our society's commitment to universal knowledge through the public library system.
