  Red Hen Press is committed to publishing works of literary excellence,
  supporting diversity, and promoting literacy in our local schools.
project_proposal_description: >-
  Twenty-four years ago, Dr. Kate Gale and Mark E. Cull founded Red Hen Press
  because they wanted to create a place for literature that could not find a
  home in New York publishing houses. They believed that Los Angeles could be a
  literary city, “Paris by the Pacific,” a home for literature, diversity, and
  creation in an ecosystem of artistic intellectual activity. Today, Los Angeles
  is home to many writing programs, presses, bookstores, and the Los Angeles
  Times Festival of Books, with Red Hen at the forefront of this thriving
  literary community. To date, Red Hen Press has published 438 books from 294
  authors of many genders, ethnicities, sexualities, religions, and abilities.
  132 of these authors have been women or nonbinary individuals.
   
   
   
   Our WITS program directly supports our mission by promoting literacy in our local schools and increasing the diversity of the Los Angeles literary community. Since 2003, WITS has provided free creative writing workshops and books to over 4,000 low-income students in the third through twelfth grades. The program currently supports approximately 250 students at five Los Angeles area schools each year. During the 2017-2018 school year, participating students exhibited a 95% increase in interest in writing poetry and an increased knowledge of literary terms.
   
   
   
   One fourth grade boy was very disruptive and distracted when his first WITS workshop started, and his teacher told us that he usually didn’t like school and was very vocal about it. But once the WITS lesson got started, he told us that the example poem our instructor chose was the best poem he’d ever heard, and he was so excited about it that he eagerly wrote his own poetry and even volunteered to share it with the class when he was done. His teacher was amazed by his excitement, since she had been struggling for months to find something that would hold his interest and get him to feel positively about school.

project_measure: >-
  Red Hen Press will measure performance by tracking sales figures through both
  the online interface of our distributor and internal recordkeeping. All titles
  have sales goals and promotional efforts will be viewed in light of these
  goals. Results will be gathered quarterly for internal reviews and
  disseminated annually through royalty reports to authors. Red Hen will also
  measure success through the amount of media coverage achieved, and will track
  its results through Google Alerts and social media macros. Finally, Red Hen
  would measure its book publication success by measuring the attendance at its
  related literary events. We define success as meeting our sales goals and
  increasing engagement with potential readers and contributors across all
  platforms.
   
   
   
   For its Writing in the Schools program, Red Hen would measure its success by measuring the number of students reached and by evaluating their progress over the course of the program. Red Hen provides students with evaluations both before and after their participation in the program to measure the amount of literary vocabulary they have learned along with changes in their writing self-confidence, confidence in sharing aloud, and interest in creative self-expression.

  Red Hen Press will follow its existing protocol for publishing new books,
  organizing literary events, awarding manuscript prizes, and running its
  Writing in the Schools youth outreach program. The press estimates that it
  serves about 20,000 people per year. Our authors vary widely in terms of race,
  ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and socioeconomic status, and we
  believe our readership mirrors this diversity. Roughly half of the press's
  annual output of books will be published in the spring, and half in the fall.
  This includes editorial and design work done to polish and lay out the
  manuscript and marketing work done to promote the title both before and after
  publication. Likewise, Red Hen's events will primarily take place over the
  course of two seasons, with exact dates to be determined. All together, this
  work will help make LA the best place to CREATE by doing significant work to
  promote literary arts in Los Angeles; as Southern California's largest
  nonprofit publisher, we are in a unique position to offer aspiring authors a
  platform and to strengthen our literary community overall.
