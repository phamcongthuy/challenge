title: The Campus to Career Initiative
project_description: >-
  Entertainment is one of LA's biggest industries, yet its leadership does not
  accurately represent the people of LA: 23% of leadership positions are held by
  women; women of color, 5%. Women In Film, in partnership with The California
  State University Entertainment Alliance, will launch the Campus to Career
  Initiative for women from underrepresented communities in LA County. These
  students will receive engaged, personalized guidance through their journeys
  from internship to employment in Hollywood

  “After years of getting ‘no’s’ by all of the grants you've ever heard of, we
  persisted and received Women In Film Finishing Fund cash flow during the post
  production of my debut feature, JOSH (Against The Grain), a foreign language
  mystery thriller shot in Pakistan. The year was 2012, and that lucky year, I
  requested WIF to introduce me to their Netflix contact, which they did without
  hesitation. Netflix was a relatively new player on the block back then. What
  resulted was a distribution deal from Netflix and an introduction to a bigger
  digital aggregator. The film was the first Pakistani film to be on Netflix, be
  in the permanent selection of the Library of Congress and 3 years later, it is
  still running in festivals and on SVOD platforms around the world. It was more
  than the money that made the Finishing Funding so important. It was the
  symbolism. What we needed desperately then was validation. Women In Film’s
  ‘yes’ broke the pattern of ‘no’s.’ In a lot of ways, that was both the tipping
  point of the journey of the film - and for me - in the business. Don't ever
  underestimate what organizational validation and support means to an
  independent film. It takes a lot to float in the indie world, and every chance
  of support can help keep talented filmmakers above water. Take a risk on us
  and we will take the risks that cinema needs to stay alive and thriving."

  Our evaluation will be based on feedback from participants on how the program
  elevated their confidence and abilities, the number of interviews and meetings
  arranged within program parameters, and ultimately any resulting hires. We
  will also be tracking the number of companies signed on to take the hiring
  trainings, and how many new candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, and
  any CCI participants, they interview and ultimately hire. Again, because we
  know this type of preparation can’t be complete within a year, we anticipate a
  100% success rate in securing job interviews and general meetings, and would
  aim for a 10% hire rate (or 3 participants) within the first year. Following
  this first program year, we would like to develop a CCI Alumni Program that
  continues to not only supports program grads but also ensure they can support
  each other while paying it forward to become future CCI mentors to the next
  generation of locally-based industry leaders.

  If the entertainment industry is to become fully representative of the world
  for which it creates content, the historically selective pipeline through
  which Hollywood finds its labor force must be expanded intentionally from
  student age through senior-level hires. In this pilot phase, the Campus to
  Career Initiative (CCI) will consist of regular professional development
  workshops, one-on-one advisement, and individualized job strategies for a
  cohort of selected students. In conjunction, CCI will develop a training
  course for entertainment companies interested in expanding their workforces to
  truly represent the city and county. 
   
   
   
   The size and diversity of the CSU student population are profound. In 2017, 484,297 students attended 23 campuses across the State with 127,366 of them in Los Angeles County. 21 of 23 CSU campuses are Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) with at least a 25% Latinx student enrollment. CSU students largely come from California and mostly remain in the state after graduation, applying the skills and knowledge they have learned to help California’s economy thrive. Nearly 13,000 Cal State students are annually working towards entertainment arts and media focused degrees.
   
    
   
   However, even with this kind of early support, across the entertainment industry and ascending its chains of command, women of color remain underrepresented in all positions, especially positions of power. According to 2017 US Census Data, the City of Los Angeles is 50% women, and 72% communities of color. And in a telling example of the LA student population, CSULA is comprised of 58% women students and 94% students of color. In the 2019 report, “Inclusion in the Director’s Chair” by USC Annenberg’s Inclusion Initiative, data show that at the executive levels of the six largest entertainment companies, women make up only 23% of leadership (across C-suite, boards, and executive film teams) and women of color, 5%. 
   
   
   
   The initial CCI cohort of 30 women students will be selected through The CSUEA’s internship program and have a demonstrated interest in an executive career path. CCI will begin its curriculum design process in the early Fall of 2019 for both the workshops for students and trainings for companies. Student workshops will include basic skill building such as resumes and interviewing for entertainment, but also issues prioritized by WIF such as understanding gender bias and confidence building. Participant applications will open in late Fall, with the aim of selecting participants for the beginning of Spring semester 2020. The program for students will formally take place over one year. By the end of one year, participants will be equipped with a deep skill set to help them excel at interviews and internships, and will have had opportunities to put these skill set to use. Company trainings will be planned for a 2020 start as well, informed and partially delivered by CCI student participants, and delivered to companies partnering with The CSUEA.
