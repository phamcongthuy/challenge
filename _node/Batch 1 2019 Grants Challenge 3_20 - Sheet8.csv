211787470,Climate Uprising,Climate Uprising is a global call for climate action powered by stories of people impacted by the climate crisis and community events.,"Thereâ€™s a lot of special interests in climate denial and obfuscation impacting social media, news, Washington and business decisions. Breaking through the noise and changing hearts and minds on a topic that is complicated, interconnected and non-linear is a great challenge. However, we know, from direct experience and history, that story and community combined have the power to change the world. By sharing real stories first hand from real people, empathy and understanding -- the best aspects of humanity -- are unlocked. By bringing people together, giving them the mic, connecting policy makers and experts with citizens, we can foster understanding, trust, take action together and increase accountability. By spreading real, diverse stories we are connecting more people with truth, hence understanding of why change is necessary. By equipping youth with skills to tell and share stories, we are completing a recipe of positive contagion.","There are numerous grassroots initiatives, such as Climatestoriesproject.org, but they lack the social media savvy and network to maximize the power and impact of their important work. We can take personal stories and connect the dots with the larger issue, and then connect them with talented storytellers. 
 
 
 
 Other projects, like â€œYears of Living Dangerouslyâ€ are rooted in star power to generate online content, but we are building a peopleâ€™s movement via social media tools, rooted in personal stories. We're looking to be a platform to help empower those with the stories to tell. Ours is scalable.

235304658,Women's Center for Creative Work,"The Women's Center for Creative Work is a LA-based intersectional feminist arts space that is building community & elevating the work of women & non-binary artists, makers, & creative practitioners.","With the explosive commercial development taking place in Los Angeles, our main barrier is affordability, both with the prospect of long term rent if we arenâ€™t able to buy, and in executing a plan to purchase a building. Commercial leases are incredibly tough, with the possibility for rent to rise excessively at the end of each lease term. This makes sustaining community-based arts organizations for longer than 5-10 years incredibly difficult. We see purchasing a building as the primary way to fight against these effects, allowing WCCW to have security in its location, but also allowing the organization to really invest deeply in the neighborhood where itâ€™s located. 
 
 
 
 We believe we have the community support to overcome this challenge and to raise the necessary investments.","There are many organizations, artists, and collectives doing feminist and anti-oppressive work in Los Angeles, but none directly replicate what Womenâ€™s Center for Creative Work is doing. We are differentiated from most by a physical, public programming space and by the explicit focus on art making. We pride ourselves on being a space that utilizes its resources to support the work of like-minded and complementary organizations and practices and would be able to expand the way we are able to do that with a permanent space.","For this project, how we would define success, is the ability to successfully purchase a building within the next year. This main components of this success would include creating the legal structure that would allow for investors to collectively purchase; identifying and gaining commitments from investors; securing a bank loan; and identifying a building within our budget. 
 
 
 
 Additionally, the building would offer better distribution of space, allowing for more residency and exhibition, as well as programming space. We would also like expanded co-working space and areas for shared resources like woodworking equipment, studio space, and a ceramics set-up with a kiln.","Down Payment: $700,000

The security of a space is fundamental in continuing to serve the community of women and nonbinary creative practitioners that has synthesized around WCCW, and to grow our collective resource offerings including a co-work space, artist in residence program and exhibition space, a print lab and press, a feminist library, and many programs, events, and workshops.",['East LA'],Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"In 2013, co-founders Kate Johnston, Katie Bachler and Sarah Williams all went and saw the exhibition â€œDoinâ€™ it in Publicâ€ at Otis College of Art and Design. The exhibition was part of the Gettyâ€™s Pacific Standard Time and exhibited a vast sampling of the archival print and design materials from The Womanâ€™s Building. Before that day, we knew very little about The Womanâ€™s Building, or the Feminist Studio Workshopâ€“the feminist art school run out of the spaceâ€“but we left the show deeply inspired and invested in finding where this intersection of artmaking and feminism might be in contemporary Los Angeles. 
 
 
 
 With no luck in finding something similar, we decided to gather our communities to discuss. We started with no intention of forming an organization. In the beginning we hosted a series of dinners, first one out in the desert where Katie was living at the time, and the second in the shadow of the historic Womanâ€™s Building in Downtown L.A. The communities that came out to these events swelled, in numbers and enthusiasm, and pushed us towards establishing something that would have more longevityâ€“a place where these types of conversations and community building could happen on a regular basis. 
 
 
 
 Excitedly we entered into a â€œYear Long Laboratoryâ€ where we examined histories, economies, community, and space as it would effect this burgeoning organization. Serendipitously, at the end of the year, we applied and received a grant from spART, which allowed us to take a leap of faith, paying a deposit and the first two months rent on a space. Since that time in Spring 2015, weâ€™ve built this organization into a robust and impactful nonprofit organization with over 550 contributing members, and thousands of people attending programs annually.

 We have done all of this out of a small space in Elysian Valley for the past four years. With just one more year on our lease, we are applying to LA2050 to garner initial funds to help us collectively purchase a building and move into a permanent home. This $100,000 would serve partially to fund WCCWâ€™s stake in the building, and partially for any necessary maintenance or build out. We would work collaboratively with a few other members of our expended community who would also purchase shares in the cooperatively owned building. To fund any remaining costs, WCCW will take out a bank loan that will be paid off monthly, at a rate comparable to our current rent costs. 
 
 
 
 From late Spring through early Fall 2019, we will be working to secure financial commitments from potential partners. In Fall and Winter we will work to establish the legal structures that will allow for the purchasing process, secure necessary bank loans, and start identifying buildings.

We want to celebrate the work of many talented artists, photographers and filmmakers who have used the medium of 3-D as their creative tool, and to educate the public on the art and science of stereography, from it's analog beginnings in the 1830s to the immersive digital realms of the future. By actively engaging with the public through exhibitions of stereoscopic works, we will provide a positive basis for forming new opinions and advancing this art form for our participants.","The LA 3-D Club, founded in 1955, is the most active membership-based organization in the country for 3-D enthusiasts.

Clearly there is a gap in the public education about stereoscopic vision and our perception of the world around us.
 
 
 
 the inspiration for the 3-D SPACE organization began in 2012, when 3-D SPACE founder Eric Kurland and 3-D historian Ray Zone were able to rescue three truckloads of artifacts from the estate of the late 3-D expert and collector Dan Symmes. They were able to do this thanks to an angel benefactor who backed the purchase of the items on the condition that they do something positive with it. Ray and Eric discussed the possibility of someday finding a place to display these materials. Sadly, Ray passed away before they were able to move forward with any plans, but the idea continued to grow
 
 
 
 Eric developed the idea for 3-D SPACE into a plan of action and decided that starting a nonprofit would be the best route to move forward. 3-D SPACE was granted 501(c)3 nonprofit tax-exempt status in March, 2015. The museum collection grew when 3-D SPACE began receiving donations from private collectors and estates, portions of Ray Zoneâ€™s personal 3-D collection.
 
 
 
 For the first three years after its formation, we maintained a workshop and storage facility for the collections, but had no public space. 3-D SPACE operated as a museum without a permanent home, presenting movie screenings, educational workshops and outreach events in collaboration with other museums, organizations and nonprofits.
 
 
 
 At the beginning of 2018, 3-D SPACE was offered the opportunity to lease a brand new basement space. This new area was small, but had the potential to work as an exhibit gallery. Finally, in the Summer of 2018, 3-D SPACE opened the doors of its starter museum in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Affectionately nicknamed the ""3-D Bunker,"" the center is a public space for stereoscopic art, science, and history. We are utilizing the gallery to rotate between exhibiting pieces from our museum collection, displaying contemporary works by 3-D image makers, and holding classes and presentations.","3-D SPACE is the singular applicant for this grant.

However, once organizations and their teams mapped out communications timelines, and it was evident that Pro Bono Tech participants were committed to the work, work plan execution and collaboration between the team and the nonprofit partner generally went smoothly.
 
 
 
 It is also clear that in-person meetings are necessary for the best overall experience. During our second pilot, we built in several mandatory in-person meetings. Organizations and teams who met in person reported a better overall experience and satisfaction with final deliverables. Though we have identified these challenges, and have developed and tested strategies to overcome them, we anticipate that these challenges may continue to come up when partnering with new nonprofit partners and as such, we may need to develop a more robust repository of testimonials and case studies in an attempt to assuage some of these potential concerns.","There are several organizations that match professionals with nonprofit volunteer opportunities, and they typically fall into one of two categories - a search engine for volunteer opportunities (e.g., Taproot, Catchafire) or a full-service firm providing a range of services to mid-sized and large nonprofits (e.g., verynice).

But we also know that technology is a tool that will only be effective if it is built as a result of inclusive processes that partners nonprofits and digital professionals together in a way that fosters shared understanding, trust, buy-in, and accountability.
 
 
 
 Our program is high touch and we intentionality designed our model to create clear structures of accountability, a defined scope and objectives, and a balance of skills and backgrounds in building a successful pro bono team - at no financial cost to the nonprofits or the volunteers. This approach is what differentiates our Pro Bono Tech program from other organizations in the space.","Ultimately, we believe weâ€™ve proven through our pilots that thereâ€™s real value in designing opportunities for digital professionals to give pro bono time to nonprofits, and our progress in developing a pro bono tech culture in Los Angeles can be measured in the number of Pro Bono Tech participants and volunteer hours. Additionally, investing the proper time and grounding program design in the expressed preferences of all stakeholders resulted in measurable value for our nonprofits during our pilots as well, both in the form of pro bono work valued at nearly $600,000 (i.e., savings for our nonprofit partners) and the completion of projects that were designed to be sustainable within the nonprofit, independent of the volunteer. 
 
 
 
 Furthermore, whereas ad hoc, online, or poorly managed pro bono engagements result in dissatisfied parties on both ends, the model we piloted actually resulted in participants and nonprofits wanting to do more pro bono, not less. In that sense, our pilot around project management, scoping, communication, managing expectations, structuring engagement, and providing value to volunteers succeeded in designing a model program that overcame the hurdles that are specific to offering digital skills pro bono. If we can continue to run the Pro Bono Tech program with the same outcomes as our pilots, we believe that we will be successful in building the pro bono tech ecosystem in LA so that it becomes as ubiquitous as pro bono work in the legal industry.","--Technology--

 We think that our participants said it best in their own words when describing their experiences volunteering with our nonprofit partners:
 
 
 
 â€œI believe that the most efficient way for me to give back to society is to utilize my most valuable skills, which are more tech and business related. Although I feel that helping out in a homeless shelter or mentoring kids is very meaningful, I might not be able to make as much of an impact as compared to doing what I am best at - analyzing data. A well-thought out strategy and execution by a team of digital professionals could benefit a non-profit entities tremendously, especially when resources are usually limited for charitable organizations.â€
 
 
 
 â€œTaking on a challenge such as this one will help me to grow and get better at my own work, while also advancing the mission of other organizations that are most in need of help.â€
 
 
 
 â€œThe pro bono tech opportunity allows me to give back in a way that extends my reach and impact through collaboration with peers in defining and creating solutions that address social issues.â€

We work closely with our partners to identify obstacles that impede their strategic priorities and determine where technology or digital expertise can help. 
 
 
 
 In order to set our partner organizations and digital professional participants up for success, we address these challenges in the following ways:
 
 
 
 1. We Pre-Scope Each Project. 
 
 Many digital professionals who set out to do pro bono work can encounter unexpected â€œtechnical debt,â€ which greatly increases their workload and often leads to burn-out and unfinished projects. We mitigate this risk by working collaboratively with our nonprofit partners to pre-scope projects in order to anticipate potential obstacles incoming teams may encounter, allowing us to better prepare them. 
 
 
 
 2. We Make Sure The Work Aligns With the Nonprofitsâ€™ Strategic Goals.
 
 We focus on projects that tie directly to our partnersâ€™ strategic priorities so that we can be sure our teams are delivering high-impact work. Our partners understand that in order for the Pro Bono Tech teams to function at their highest level, they will need a solid communication plan and feedback loop in place. By tying projects to strategic priorities, we can ensure that both our partners and Pro Bono Tech teams are able to give and get what they want out of their projects. 
 
 
 
 3. We Recruit An Entire Cohort of Digital Professionals
 
 We design the Pro Bono Tech experience around a cohort model. The cohort model cultivates a sense of community and gives digital professionals the opportunity to problem solve outside of their direct teams. 
 
 
 
 4. We Put Together Multidisciplinary Teams of Digital Professionals
 
 All of this prep work allows us to much more accurately determine the skill sets and disposition needed for each project. Rather than matching an individual to a project, we build diverse teams to work on projects together. We accept digital professionals into the Pro Bono Tech program based on their skill sets and allow them to select onto projects themselves based on their interests. 
 
 
 
 By using this system, we have a remarkably high-rate of success in placing professionals on teams where theyâ€™re not only able to utilize their skill sets, but are also contributing to a cause they believe in. Many of our partner nonprofits do not have the staff capacity or budget to do this work on their own, and having access to an entire team of digital professionals provides value beyond the project deliverables. 98% of our nonprofit partners and digital professional participants were interested in participating as part of another Pro Bono Tech project.

 While our targeted demographics represent the sector of the population poised to make the most gains in the small business landscape, they face stressors such as added familial and financial responsibilities, as well as pressures to take extra courses to graduate on time. To mitigate attrition and reduce the perceived burden that can make recruitment harder, the overall strategy involves creating RII as an integrative experience and opportunity that can actually help students address the stressors they face while also advancing. Specific examples include:
 
 -Having RII count towards course work necessary for graduation;
 
 -Providing a small stipend for participants (either direct payment or contribution that reduces financial aid burden);
 
 -Emphasis on and access to resources that help with organization, as well as time and stress management;
 
 
 
 Successful Founding of a Business. 
 
 However, even in the best of circumstances, the rates of new business failure are high. Our overall strategy would be to use best practices to mitigate failure, facilitate relatively quick recovery and enhance resilience. Specific methods include:
 
 -Providing a strong network of committed mentors and sponsors;
 
 -Creating a strong curriculum and related hands on opportunities that provides a wealth of knowledge, resources and building of critical skill sets that are invaluable to entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs; and
 
 -Teach methods for creating passive income.","DO GOOD LA: SOCIAL INNOVATION FAST PITCH

Formerly known as ""Small Business Strong,"" Conaxion was the winner of the 2016 Mayorâ€™s Cup, a social impact initiative introduced by Los Angeles City Mayor Eric Garcetti. The team comprised of undergraduates from Cal State LA across multiple disciplines including engineering, business and nutrition who took top honors for its idea for a mobile small business resource center housed in a van, which delivers mentorship opportunities and pathways to capital to under-served, underrepresented, and under-connected small business owners. Conaxion is now a fully operating 501(c)(3) nonprofit. 
 
 
 
 The Mayorâ€™s Cup is a competition for young entrepreneurs at L.A. universities to pitch innovative solutions for tackling the cityâ€™s biggest challenges. Competitors were asked to develop ideas to address one of two issues: growing L.A.â€™s economy or civic engagement in neighborhoods. More than 100 teams applied, with graduate students from UCLA, USC and LMU competing in the final five.
 
 
 
 Since Conaxion has won The Mayorâ€™s Cup, they have inspired students campus wide to explore entrepreneurship in a socially innovative way. The University has further engaged Conaxion to provide mentoring to students participating in hackathons and business pitch competitions, helping them explore creative and efficient ways to start social enterprises. 
 
 
 
 CaSIG wanted to create more sustained and permanent opportunities within the campus for students across multiple disciplines that could help them achieve the success of Conaxion by connecting studentâ€™s classroom experience, intrinsic ingenuity and needs of their communities.","The partnership with Conaxion would 1) use a human-centric approach to empower students to create goods and services that harness solutions to community issues in the areas that they actually live, work and play. We will be equipping students with skills and tools to develop and grow their ideas, and this is done with our hands-on training that will bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world application. These tools and skills are derived from the five-step process of design thinking methodologyâ€”which consists of empathizing with your target audience, defining the problem, idealization to develop a solution, prototyping the solution, testing the solution with target customers and iterating once more before bringing goods or services to market; and 2) utilize a satellite location that is not only in the heart of South LA, but in the Promise Zone. The Promise Zone is defined as high poverty areas where the federal government partners with local leaders to improve educational opportunities, increase economic activity, leverage private investment, enhance public health and most importantly, address other priorities identified by the community. Testing products or services in the community will help with the development of students' soft skills that are necessary to communicate effectively and efficiency. Students will build the confidence to test their ideas and turn meaningful ideas into practical solutions that will benefit the under-served community in which they live in. The instant feedback of the community will help them become better leaders and build better products.

The RII also supports students through business pitch competitions where they are able to validate and evolve their ideas, while competing for seed money for their startup.
 
 
 
 The RII will reside on the Cal State LA campus along with a satellite space at our partner organizationâ€” Conaxion, a nonprofit in South LA that focuses on economic development of small businesses. Students will learn the fundamentals of empathizing with their target audience, defining a problem and ideating a solution at Cal State LA. Conaxion will help students build out their solution with prototyping and gamification tools (e.g. 3D printers & pens, applications) using a human-centric approach to test products, and iterate once more before going to market.
 
 
 
 The Cal State LA community is bordered by four low-income, predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods: El Sereno, East Los Angeles, Lincoln Heights and Boyle Heights. These communities represent part of the 86% of Cal State LA students who come from Los Angeles County. In fact, 87% of the students apply for financial aid and nearly all are granted need-based aid, reflecting the surrounding low-income communities. Furthermore, over 60% of the 29,000 student population is Hispanic, thus explaining the Universityâ€™s Hispanic Serving Institution status. By expanding the current programming of CaSIG with the addition of the RII, it will directly impact the all the communities that our students represent.

 The experience of a single mother, Tammy (her name is changed), and her two sons provides compelling evidence of the impact of Esperanzaâ€™s program. Two years ago, a community organization referred Tammy to Esperanza because of her sonsâ€™ asthma.
 
 
 
 When Esperanzaâ€™s Promotora de Salud (Community Health Promoters) visited Tammyâ€™s home in South Los Angeles, she was struck by the strong scent of bleach. Tammy and her sons lived in an apartment that was infested with roaches and had a serious mold problem. In her effort to provide her sons with a clean environment, she vigorously cleaned the apartment with bleach daily.
 
 
 
 Esperanzaâ€™s Promotora explained to Tammy that the bleach was a trigger for asthma and likely exacerbating the severity of her sonsâ€™ asthma. The Promotora gave Tammy a cleaning bucketâ€ with containers of oxygen peroxide and baking soda, a spray bottle, cleaning rags, gloves and a mask. Along with a recipe to make a safe cleaning.
 
 
 
 The Promotora explained to Tammy that people often believe the scent of bleach equates to a clean environment. The reality is that the scent of bleach often triggers asthma attacks. Unlike other programs, Healthy Homes/Healthy Breathing program not only educates people, but gives them the actual tools to implement immediate changes in their environment. In Tammyâ€™s case, Esperanza also gave her with a vacuum with a HEPA filter vacuum. The combination eliminating bleach, using safer cleaning products and a vacuum had a dramatic impact on the health of Tammyâ€™s sons.

Missed school and work days because of asthma, as well as frequent emergency department visits generate emotional and financial stress for families. 
 
 
 
 Project Timeline: The Healthy Homes/Healthy Breathing Program serves a minimum of 175 individuals per year. Program staff meet with patients at least four times over a 12-month period to conduct assessment, education, intervention, and evaluation.
 
 
 
 How the project will help to make LA the best place to LIVE: Supporting the ability to control indoor air quality is a way to empower families as they continue to advocate for their own health. Esperanzaâ€™s program is a proven approach to address the health disparities in a region that has suffered from persistent disinvestment. More than simple asthma education, Esperanzaâ€™s Healthy Homes/Healthy Breathing Program helps community members address this controllable chronic disease by improving indoor air quality. Esperanzaâ€™s Healthy Homes/Healthy Breathing Program will support families in creating sustainable changes to improve health outcomes by reducing environmental triggers by 75%; decreasing preventable emergency department use by both pediatric and adult patients with asthma by 65%, and decreasing missed school or work days by our participants by 50%.",,Active,LIVE,,,Voting Period,

517826824,NewFilmmakers Los Angeles,NewFilmmakers Los Angeles (NFMLA) is a non-profit 501(c) 3 organization designed to showcase innovative works by both domestic and international emerging filmmakers at annual screenings in LA County.,"NFMLA wants to showcase films by filmmakers who truly represent the diversity within Los Angeles. The organization has outreach methods in place, but there has been a lack of response from specific areas in the county, such as Long Beach and East/Southeast LA area (Bellflower, Cerritos, Norwalk, Whittier, Lakewood, Huntington Park, Commerce, Carson, Signal Hill, Monterrey Park, Montebello and South Gate).
 
 
 
 NFMLA has promoted outreach to all of LA County, however, the organization cannot afford ""targeted"" posts to all of the neighborhoods in LA, which is why NFMLA is seeking funding to help with outreach costs. This is especially helpful because we are an organization with a staff of 4 people, one of whom works remotely. The staff is constantly busy due to the lack of personnel, so even thought the staff wants to visit these areas and provide them with all of the information on the program, they just do not have the bandwidth to do so. 
 
 
 
 With support from the LA2050 Grants Challenege, the organization would be able to allocate costs towards updating the event design, conducting additional outreach methods (targeted social media posts, community and university visits, etc.) for filmmakers, attendees, student (filmmakers and attendees), community collaborators and also for staff time in regards to outreach.","While there are many film festivals in Los Angeles County, NFMLA is the only organization that hosts a place-based film festival in regards to the entire area of Los Angeles. The conclusion of the ""On Location"" project invites all LA locals to a screening in the heart of Los Angeles so that they can connect with both the films, filmmakers and fellow Angelenos. On average, over 500 people attend the screening each year. 
 
 
 
 The ""On Location"" project highlights the diversity within the many communities of LA County, not just one particular area, which is what sets us apart from other festivals in LA that only highlight filmmakers from specific backgrounds or geographical locations. NFMLA looks at LA County as one big family, which is why the organization supports filmmakers from all of the diverse neighborhoods within LA.","NFMLA will define and measure success for the ""On Location"" project through audience surveys, which are administered at the event to the 500+ attendees by trained volunteers and a staff supervisor. This method was used at last yearâ€™s â€œOn Locationâ€ event and after reviewing the evaluations the organization found the feedback from the surveys to be paramount in the planning stages of the 2019 edition of the program. Likewise, NFMLA surveys the participating filmmakers so that the organization can improve practices starting from the early outreach and submission stages of the project to the screening of their films at the showcase event. 
 
 
 
 The survey evaluations consist of questions regarding topics related to the filmmakers and attendeeâ€™s experiences. Attendees and Filmmakers both receive questions about the overall quality of the event design (venue, films, furniture, staff, food/beverages, etc.). This way NFMLA can always take feedback from attendees and past filmmakers to better improve the program. The organization has not
 
 
 
 Outreach methods will be evaluated through these surveys as well. A question on the survey asks for what LA neighborhood they live in so that the organization can evaluate the responses and produce outreach to even more underrepresented communities. The data from last year's survey is what fueled the organization's desire to produce more outreach, in all regards (filmmakers, attendees, students and community collaborators) to areas that were not as well represented at the 2018 ""On Location"" screening event including Long Beach and the East/Southeast LA area.","If awarded, NFMLA would allocate the funds towards event design and materials, targeted outreach methods across all major social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) and staff time. 
 
 
 
 In regards to staff time, NFMLA's Executive Director, Larry Laboe, will produce additional outreach to community collaborators from all over the county to better represent organizations and companies within LA County. The organization's Programming Director, Bojana Sandic, will conduct additional outreach to filmmakers in LA neighborhoods so that more underrepresented groups of filmmakers in LA County are aware of the program. Likewise, NFMLA's Events and Outreach Director, Andrew Acedo, will work extra hours on facilitating the targeted social media posts to Long Beach and East/Southeast LA so that more members of the LA community attend the event so that the audience reflect the diversity within the county. Lastly, NFMLA's Educational Coordinator, Cassandra Coppola, will conduct outreach to more universities so that students are aware that they can not only attend the event, but also submit their films to the project as well.

 Total: $100,000.00","Since the program has been sustainable for 9-years, the organization has the support and funding to plan and orchestrate the On Location: The Los Angeles Video Project. However, the project would stay exactly as it is. The organization is trying to grow the project's funding so that the organization can not only provide participants with more accommodating event design, but also produce more targeted outreach to under-served areas in the county so that a more LA filmmakers have the chance to participate in the project.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","NFMLA will host the 9th edition of the organizationâ€™s annual On Location: The Los Angeles Video Project at Sunset Las Palmas Studios on October 5th, 2019. The project invites local LA independent filmmakers from diverse communities to express their vision of LA by crafting a film under five-minute long based on the prompt â€œWhatâ€™s your L.A.?â€ NFMLA then gives these artists the opportunity to showcase their films to hundreds of local residents at an event in the heart of Los Angeles.","['Central LA', 'East LA', 'San Gabriel Valley', 'San Fernando Valley', 'South LA', 'Westside', 'South Bay', 'Antelope Valley', 'County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)', 'LAUSD']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"Through the On Location: The Los Angeles Video Project, NFMLA inspires local filmmakers to create a film that depicts their vision of LA. The impact comes from the 500+ LA locals that come out to the event each year. The attendees watch films that educate them about important LA topics, which results in sparking a community dialogue about LA and how it serves its residents.
 
 
 
 For example, at the 2018 â€œOn Locationâ€ event, NFMLA programmed the film â€œThis Is My LAâ€ by Kristine M. Skeie and Connor Buss, which is a documentary about Kristineâ€™s experiences with accessibility for the differently-abled community. 
 
 
 
 Two more documentaries that were shown during the 2018 â€œOn Locationâ€ event include â€œAngelino Profiles: Dona Juliaâ€ which is documentary that tells the deep story of a Guatemalan immigrant who has been collecting bottles and cans in Los Angeles for 17 years, and â€œLegacyâ€ which is a film about a Filipino immigrant, who documented his life through video once his dream of coming to America came true with his daughter by his side.
 
 
 
 Narratives that have been screened at the event reflect the stories of certain characteristics that are specific to the city of LA. For example, at the 2018 â€œOn Locationâ€ event, NFMLA displayed the film â€œLiftedâ€ which is a story about a rideshare driver who is stuck in the well-known LA Traffic with a stubborn passenger. Likewise, NFMLA showed a film titled â€œMountain Climbingâ€ which does justice to the beauty of the cityâ€™s vast landscape that features mountains, deserts, plains, beaches and more. Another narrative includes â€œTil I See Youâ€ which tells the story of a man named Thomas who has to leave his boyfriend Tyler due to unforeseen circumstances, but wants to give him one last fun vacation in the vibrant city of Los Angeles. 
 
 
 
 NFMLA has screened many more films that have depicted other LA stigmas including documentaries on actors who spent their life trying to make it in Hollywood, music videos that show LAâ€™s many museums, artworks, parks and monuments, stories of children who grew up in the heart of LA and many more.","All of NFMLA's collaborators provide resources or monetary support for the On Location: The Los Angeles Video Project.

 NFMLA's four full-time staff members executes the program starting months in advance with promotional outreach to LA County filmmakers, potential community attendees, students, sponsors and collaborators.
 
 
 
 Activities for the â€œOn Location The Los Angeles Video Projectâ€ begin when the â€œCall for Submissionsâ€ is released to the LA community through the organizationâ€™s website, social media, newsletter and also through partner organizations and their networks. Filmmakers then have two-months, from June to August, to create a film under 5-minutes that depicts their view of the city of Los Angeles. 
 
 
 
 In August, after the 26 filmmakers are selected, their name and their films synopsis are then posted on the â€œOn Locationâ€ webpage where the public will be able to see a list of all of the films and the filmmakers before attending the event. 
 
 
 
 The â€œOn Locationâ€ screening event, where all of the films will be displayed for the community, takes place in October 2019. The films are divided into two programs so that the Los Angeles attendees and filmmakers have the chance to mingle while eating, drinking before the next film program starts. 
 
 
 
 The donation portion of the night is when filmmakers are given resources, services and equipment by NFMLAâ€™s partnering organizations (worth over $65,000 overall). A breakdown of all of the donations can be found on the program's webpage. The end of the screening event concludes the project for the year. 
 
  
 
 Population:
 
 The population being served includes over 120+ local filmmakers, who create and submit their films to the NFMLA. Of those filmmakers, 26 films are showcased at the screening event in October 2019. In regards to the breakdown of the filmmakers for 2018, 60% were made by filmmakers of color, 50% were made by female filmmakers. NFMLA hopes to further improve these numbers for the 2019 ""On Location"" project. 
 
 
 
 Measured Progress:
 
 The project will make measurable progress towards making LA the best place to connect through the art of storytelling in the medium of cinema. NFMLA has conducted annual Audience and Filmmaker Surveys for the ""On Location"" program, which is where they can give NFMLA feedback that the organization later evaluates in an effort to see what people enjoyed at the event vs. what additions they would like to see in the program the following year. In regards to audience, over 500+ LA locals attend the screening event.
 
 
 
 2019 Project Goals include:
 
 â€¢ Create career advancing opportunities for local filmmakers from across LA County to create short-films that display their unique perspective on the city. 
 
 â€¢ Gain recognition for local filmmakers by premiering their films each year to a growing audience of over 500+ attendees at the screening, which provides over $65,000 worth of production support services. 
 
 â€¢ Connect the diverse LA communities by establishing dialogue between audience-members and filmmakers.
 
 â€¢ Provide low-ticket prices and free submission costs to LA community",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,
553548550,Shared Harvest,Shared Harvest is on a mission to champion volunteerism while also helping students and professionals crush their student loan debt one social good at a time.,"Capital access and warm introductions to strategic partners remains the major barrier Shared Harvest faces. Minority entrepreneurs have limited access to venture capital networks and have few allies in corporate boardrooms. Although the number of black women led startups has doubled, black female founders only raised 0.0006% of the $424.7 billion in total tech and social impact venture funding raised since 2009 (average funding raised is $42,000). However, the average funding raised by non-black women is $5 million. Racial disparity is further compounded by gender disparity: white males raise an average of $12 million. Also, service based entrepreneurs procure less capital funding than product based founders.
 
  
 
 Shared Harvest has the triple burden of being a service based platform founded by three black women, but we believe that we can defy the odds. Our strategy to raise funds includes: sales of our service to companies who care about employee wellness and diversity initiatives, city contracts with collaborating social enterprises (e.g. REDF), integration into college/university community programs departmental budgets, crowdfunding (e.g. iFundWomen), and most importantly, exceed revenue projections in the sale of our technology service and volunteer management solution to our nonprofit partners. We will use social impact venture capital raised to scale and increase our platform capabilities.","Our model is different from our competition in multiple ways. They focus on processing student loan payments on behalf of employers, loan refinancing, or syncing user spare change putting to student loan debt repayment. Shared Harvest created a platform to address the number one pain point for many millennial and professionals whoâ€™s student loan debt makes it nearly impossible for them to do pro bono work. With 67% of the workforce having some student debt, this is the most requested HR benefit by today and we are offering it in a more mindful and community impactful way. Our platform and processing service is customizable and available to anyone with student loan debt and has the heart to give back. 
 
 
 
 Shared Harvest allows active students, those who are non-traditionally employed, temporarily unemployed, or on leave, to have stability at an unstable time. They access our platform and engage in the community while using their professional skills to services nonprofits who need them most. This is also a unique opportunity to build their resume while simultaneously reducing the financial stressor of student loan debt and potential delinquencies. Shared Harvest is deliberate in its mission to offer student loan debt relief and reduction for those who want to volunteer and champion the causes that are meaningful to them by choosing a side hustle that has increasing social impact.","Shared Harvest has a targeted goal of increasing the rate of volunteerism by 5% percent in 1 year. We want to increase the number of nonprofits on our platform by a minimum of 12 in one year and aim to have 6 corporate clients with at least 20% of their workforce participating in skills-based volunteering through our platform. We will collect both quantitative and qualitative data from members of our volunteer, nonprofit, corporate, and government network so that we continually improve the level of connectedness.
 
 
 
 A major part of Shared Harvestâ€™s initiative to improve connectivity between Los Angelenos, nonprofit organizations, and businesses is our web based platform. We aim to empower professionals to define skills in broader context using technology to help build resumes that include hard and soft skills and relationships that happen on and offline. 
 
 
 
 We have identified our business objectives/goals as follows: 
 
 
 
 1) Increased minority and women engagement - targeted campaigns and measured recruitment of women and minorities to the platform from all sources (employed and unemployed)
 
 
 
 2) Increased professional human resource capacity - our Speakerbox initiative for example provides higher level professional services for nonprofits while increasing professional skills of these volunteers in public speaking 
 
 
 
 3) Impact on criminal justice reform - in our first year our company has chosen a social impact focus directly measuring how many stipends are going toward projects related to social justice by monitoring volunteer activities with partners Homeboy Industries and Uncommon Law and potential future partners like the Bail Project and UnEARTH.
 
  
 
 4) Broaden civic engagement in LA area: directly measure number of completed projects and volunteer hours against previous years and social impact created from projects (ie money saved by nonprofits/social impact and survey nonprofits on the cost-savings of projects completed.
 
 
 
 In addition to our overarching goals, we plan to monitor the specific metrics: website metrics - site visitors, number of visitors, bounce rate, average page time, number of pages viewed per session, call to action/click through rate, user ages, geographic location, ethnicity, number of projects participated, amount of student loan debt, implementing student loan debt reduction meter on website for LA. implementing total calculated volunteer hours, amount of student debtcoins earned and stipends paid out, projects completed, degrees, lender affiliation and satisfaction, employment status, and social causes as defined by our five United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.","Our budget line items are based on targeted goals and their associated objectives:

 We realize that our costs for doing business may be more than the amount requested. We have contributed personally, received financial support through crowdfunding and have gained the trust of over 450 active members and 2500+ subscribers. We will cover the additional costs by cost sharing through our membership model with nonprofit and corporate clients who subscribe to our service. Through fiscal sponsorship, we are able to receive direct donations to our UN SDG Social Cause Portfolios that help to cover stipend offerings. We are also fundraising on the iFundWomen Crowdfunding platform and reaching out to angel investors, Social Impact Investing Firms, Foundations, and corporate strategic partners.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff', 'Strategy assistance and implementation', 'shared workspace and partnership with data scientists who are collaboration with UNSDGs']","SHF curates flexible opportunities to leverage talent in the nonprofit sector while reducing student debt.

 My first job was as a water fetcher at age 4. Carrying buckets of water on my head taught me patience, efficiency and how little you can earn within a day of work. Fast forward to my familyâ€™s imigration to the USA, braiding hair and selling corn in downtown LA became my new hustle. These experiences cultivated my grit, creative resourcefulness which became invaluable as I navigated my career as a first-generation student. Iâ€™m now a solution-driven emergency room doctor and global public health practitioner who founded a platform that is disrupting the student debt crisis and helping people actualize their own self worth and value. 
 
 
 
 My co-founder Briana is also a first-generation emergency room doctor who is passionate about serving her community. With a father who always had several side hustles and a mother who went back to night school for professional advancement, she was given had a sense of responsibility instilled in her at a young age. While training for medicine was grueling, she prioritized finding the time to take care of those who helped take care of her. She is adept at wearing multiple hats: single mother, doctor, teacher, and a social entrepreneur. 
 
 
 
 We not only represent professionals with student loan debt, but the most marginalized and impacted population: black women. Women currently hold $900b in student debt with black women being the most adversely affected. Additionally , gender and racial wage gap disparities affect this population the most, even at the highest levels of education. 
 
 
 
 We have both been personally affected by the detrimental effect that student loans has on mental health. For myself, I had significant financial anxiety after complications with my first pregnancy despite being a doctor. Briana, lost her husband when he suddenly committed suicide after he struggled with the emotional weight of his achievements and feeling enough financial freedom to take the time to adequately address his mental health. His sudden death at 33 was jarring to all of us and spoke to the need for society to do better to support those who seek to better themselves.","Although this application is being submitted independently, Shared Harvest is based on meaningful partnerships between nonprofit organizations, educational institutions and local businesses.

We empower youth to reach their potential by instilling passion, resilience, and determination.","The biggest challenge in skateboarding is finding access to a close, safe place to skate. While the skate community boasts being an inclusive and accessible culture, and LA84 Foundation states that 70% of Los Angeles skaters are non-white, conditions such as poor road quality, limited park access, and unsafe neighborhoods due to gang violence or crime lead young people in these neighborhoods to feel limited in their ability to move about or play freely.
 
 
 
 By bringing skate equipment to school and community organization sites and creating mobile skateparks at each site, STOKED Skate Club creates new and safe places for students to skate. By bringing exciting and positive experiences to schools, we help students build more positive relationships to their schools and communities. After school skate programs located at school sites make it easier for students to participate by removing barriers of distance.","NextUp is a nonprofit that also provides a skateboarding afterschool. However, being based in Orange County, NextUp reaches an entirely different region and demographic to STOKED. 
 
 Eduskate is also an afterschool program centered around building skateparks at schools, but is only located at one school. Our program is unique because of our focus on mentorship, and serving low-income students of color.","We will consider this project a success when we: (1) Engage 1000+ low-income and underserved kids in skate programs, (2) Increase student access to skateboarding and skate culture by creating new play spaces and providing schools and organizations with the necessary resources to integrate skateboarding into their afterschool programs with confidence and excitement, (3) Inspire kids to be healthy, lifelong athletes by providing early positive experiences for them in sports, (4) Minimize risk of injury and meet community needs by providing safe instruction, and (5) Promote positive benefits of skateboarding to parents, administrators, and community stakeholders who will in turn be supports to students seeking to continue practicing the sport outside of the program. 
 
 
 
 We will measure this success through outputs such as: (1) Number of student participants from low-income families engaged, and (2) Number of newly created play spaces for skateboarding. We will measure student participant outcomes through a series of self-reported surveys administered periodically over the duration of the program. Surveys will measure: (1) Increases in studentsâ€™ feelings of optimism, confidence, creativity, and resilience, (2) Feelings of safety and connection to their school and community, and (3) Feelings of confidence in their skate skills and ability to teach others. 
 
 
 
 We will consider this project a success when partner sites are able to sustain programs for years to come at very low cost because the initial equipment and materials costs are not a factor.","MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

As an undocumented youth in LA, he worked throughout high school to help his family stay afloat, and often found himself responsible for caring for three younger siblings. Luckily he found the time between school work, home responsibilities, and jobs to participate in STOKED - a sanctuary in which he could decompress from the stresses he encountered on a daily basis, and channel his determination to overcome adversity and learn to skate, snowboard, and surf. Through his participation in STOKED, Erick became aware of his unhealthy lifestyle of poor eating habits, too much screen time, and limited physical activity. Inspired by STOKED and our commitment to overcoming obstacles and building resilience, he committed to being more active, eating more healthy foods, and dedicating time to play with friends that were also in STOKED. For him, these sports were never anything he saw himself being able to do, so to have an avenue to find yourself on top of a mountain or catching a wave in Malibu was monumental. He was able to learn from adult mentors that balanced their life and work with healthy amounts of play and activity. He was able to see himself being more than what he saw around him at his school, job, and home; and ultimately was awarded for such bravery by winning the Student of the Year Award in 2018. Having conquered the fear of ""dropping in"" on a skateboard, it was no problem for Erick to become an advocate for other undocumented students to see themselves conquering their daily obstacles. His relationship with his STOKED Coach, Max, was instrumental to his success. For many students, taking advantage of opportunities is a challenge, but for Erick, he immediately saw value in STOKED sports programs and college and career readiness programs. He had a safe place to try new things and learn with people who truly cared about his future. Erick is the first in his family to go to college, so he tells his story so other students can see themselves doing the same.","We will partner with Aspire Public Schools in addition to other organizations.

 We will create informal skate spaces for youth that are free from physical and emotional threats through partnerships with schools and organizations such as Aspire Public Schools with yards that can be transformed into skateparks using movable obstacles. We will provide all gear at no cost, recruit kids that are less likely to be engaged in traditional sports, as well as increase participation among girls through targeted recruitment, and provide training for coaches and professional development to ensure lessons are age appropriate. We will provide a mix of lessons and free skate over 240 min / week. Kids will learn basic skills, etiquette, and safety guidelines needed to practice the sport outside the program. And it is essential that kids have fun! We will focus on goal setting rather than winning and losing, support peer mentoring where kids build healthy relationships, engage parents to help kids carry their practice outside of the program, and use rewards and incentives to celebrate successes such as stickers and badges.

In the 25 years since our founding, we have developed solid infrastructure, hired dedicated staff and gathered the needed expertise to provide shoes for the kids who need them most. However, in the city of Los Angeles, the demand far surpasses the donations we receive. Our program is proven and it is ready. We are waiting for the people of Los Angeles to invest in their children, and in their future. Through LA2050 we will have the funds to supply over 10,000 pairs of shoes. Support from this program will be used to raise community awareness: giving our program needed exposure both in the media and in the local area. This will inspire further donations, making sure that the people of Los Angeles take care of their own.","Shoes That Fit is like no other program. By reaching out to educators, the adults that know these children's needs best, we are able to provide to children directly where they are. Shoes That Fit works directly through our partnered schools, ensuring that the children that are most in need are served. Students are first measured for a perfectly fitting shoe, and then they are provided with a pair of new shoes. This is where our program is truly unique; unlike other programs that collect used and donated shoes, we give brand new athletic shoes to children. For many children that serve in the program, this is the first time that they have received a brand new pair of shoes. It is always a privilege to see the reactions of children, who have had to rely on hand-me-downs that do not fit properly their whole lives, when they receive their gifts. Shoes That Fit's program has been proven to increase both the confidence and self-esteem of a child, all through the simple gift of a new pair of shoes.","We at Shoes That Fit define the success of our project through the number of kids we can reach and provide for throughout Los Angeles. 
 
 
 
 The success of our project will be measured through the number of children that we can reach this year and the impact on their well-being. We will also measure our ability to activate and maintain partnerships with community groups who will help us provide for children in Los Angeles well into the future. To meet these goals, Shoes That Fit regularly collects both qualitative and quantitative information. We track the number of shoes, socks and other necessities provided to each child, and survey our school liaisons, educators and volunteers on the impact that new shoes have on their students. Measurements are taken on self-esteem and confidence, participation in physical activity, behavior and academic performance.
 
 
 
 The results from our surveys in 2018 are a testament to the success of our program: 84% of liaisons who responded to the survey reported an improvement in self-esteem among the children who received new shoes; 80% reported an improvement in confidence; 80% reported an improved attitude; and nearly 70% saw students participate more in physical activities. Above all, the words of the children we serve speak to the power of a gift of new shoes. This is reflected first hand in the thank you notes we receive year after year, with one student this year writing: â€œIf it wasnâ€™t for you, I would not be able to participate in physical education. I am also thankful because I would have been walking to school without shoes.â€
 
 
 
 In the 2018, we provided over 36,205 pairs of shoes, socks and other necessities to 23,887 children in Los Angeles County alone. Through the help of funding from LA2050, we can double the number of children we are able to reach in the next five years.","The funding that we receive from LA2050 will be used directly to purchase new shoes. New athletic shoes are very expensive, with prices ranging anywhere from $15.00 to $50.00 depending on their size and availability. However, in 2014 we were able to contract with a shoe distributor who sells us shoes wholesale at a discounted price. With support from LA2050, our goal is to provide shoes for over 10,000 children in Los Angeles, changing their lives for the better.
 
 
 
 The rest of the project will require great support from our partners in Los Angeles. As stated before, the LAPD will be our ""boots on the ground"", using both their resources and manpower to deliver new shoes to children in need as identified by the educators working in their local precincts. Finally, the school educators (the ones that best know the children) will be the ones who identify the children who are most in-need and measure their shoe sizes so we can purchase their shoes.","Besides applying to LA2050, Shoes That Fit will apply to multiple organizations for grant funding to meet our goal of doubling the number of children we reach and provide for each year in the city of Los Angeles over the next five years.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","Operation Shoes That Fit LA: a high-profile initiative with the LAPD to reach students in some of the lowest income areas of LAUSD.

Two decades later, we are the nationâ€™s leading non-profit provider of new athletic shoes for low-income school aged children and teens. Last year, we provided shoes for over 130,000 students across the United States. 
 
 
 
 Shoes are one of the most expensive items that families must provide for their children, but they are necessary to even attend school. With parents working to meet basic needs, too many children have no choice but to attend school with shoes that are taped together, belong to a relative, smell, or are all those at once. At Shoes That Fit, we believe that children should be able to grow up with one less worry. Our mission is to tackle one of the most visible signs of poverty in America by giving children in need new athletic shoes to attend school with dignity and joy, prepared to learn, play and thrive. 
 
 
 
 Our challenge is reflected by the staggering rate of poverty in California, which is now 20.6% â€“ the highest in the country. Today, more than 1-in-4 children in Los Angeles, and 80% of students attending school in the LAUSD, are living in poverty. The challenges of growing up in poverty correlate with behavioral problems, lower self-esteem, and decreased educational readiness. These hurdles are placed in front of children who have absolutely no control over their personal circumstances.","We will partner with the LAPD for our project to ensure that we are effective in mobilizing Los Angeles.
 
 
 
 The LAPD will serve as the ""boots on the ground"" for our program, using their large cadre of 9,000 sworn officers committed to community policing to work with our program staff and the schools located in their local precincts. The officers will work side-by-side with the educators, measuring students and delivering new shoes to kids. They have even created a ""Operation Shoes That Fit LA"" trailer (see image attached for Part 2 of application), which will allow some students to choose a pair of shoes!

 Working with the LAUSD, the LAPD will identify schools that have high percentages of students on free or reduced cost meal programs. Educators at those schools identify and measure the students who are most in-need of new shoes. 100% of the children that will be served are from low-income families, and schools identify the children most in-need.

This has allowed us to greatly expand our programs and gain new sponsor groups, who help us provide shoes for schools in their own neighborhoods. We will continue to work with local media outlets, like KTLA, to broadcast the events held for Operation Shoes That Fit LA and raise awareness about our programs. The more awareness gained, the more inspired Angelinos become to help. Thus allowing us to provide new pairs of shoes to more children so that they attend school with dignity, joy and the chance to thrive.","In order to carry out our program we will partner with the Los Angeles Police Department who will work with us to identify schools in their local precincts who have the highest number of children in need. The LAPD will connect with these schools, with whom they already have strong ties, and will work with the educators there to identify and then measure the children who need new athletic shoes the most. 
 
 
 
 Working with the LAUSD, the LAPD will identify schools that have high percentages of students on free or reduced cost meal programs. Educators at those schools identify and measure the students who are most in-need of new shoes. 100% of the children that will be served are from low-income families, and schools identify the children most in-need. 
 
 
 
 The program will take place from May all the way through to December. These months are crucial for the program, as May is when students begin to return to school after Summer Break and December is before they leave for the holidays. Operation Shoes That Fit LA will hold events at certain times like a Back-to-School event or a Holiday gift giving event.
 
 
 
 Using funding provided by our donors, Shoes That Fit will purchase brand new athletic shoes for each child measured and identified. Officers in the LAPD will then function as our ""boots on the ground"" in the city, executing deliveries to each of the schools involved. Deliveries will take place in each school as a publicized event, where each child will be personally handed their gift of new shoes by a sworn police officer.

 The children living in this community are the future of Los Angeles. It is up to us to show them how valuable, and how valued they are. Many of these children are born into difficult situations that they have no control over, and it is more important then ever that they know there are people out there that care about them and want to help. Funding from LA2050 would be a direct investment in the children of Los Angeles - the future of Los Angeles.

Weâ€™ll take our lessons learned from the Harvard Park pilot to ensure we engage these key groups early. As we already have requests from the community and LAPD to expand into South Park, we believe this is a good early indicator that we can overcome this obstacle.","We are the only group in South LA doing this specific type of work. While there are other walking programs, we are unaware of one that brings the community and law enforcement together to connect and engage.","In the first year of the Community Safety Partnership in Harvard Park, the LAPD saw zero homicides and a 50 percent reduction in violent crime. An increase in park participation was also seen. The Community STEPS program was able to help contribute to some of this success by helping to facilitate police and community interactions. 
 
 Community STEPS could reach thousands of individuals immediately and could very quickly scale to be implemented across the 9,000 Los Angeles Police Department officers and 4 million people that they protect and serve. Additionally, there are several other metrics for measuring success associated with this program. 
 
 â€¢ Community members feel â€œsaferâ€ to walk in their communities. A goal of the 77th Division of the LAPD is to reduce crime by 15%.
 
 â€¢ Participants increasing the amount of time per day/week that they are physically active. Weâ€™ll distribute fitness trackers and leverage existing AHA programs that allow for tracking exercise. 
 
 â€¢ A reduction in blood pressure and other health metrics.
 
 â€¢ Law enforcement officers getting to better know and understand the communities in which they serve. Another goal of the 77th Division is to strengthen the community-police partnership and build morale through leadership.

The program includes healthy activities for all ages as well as wellness events to include health information booths and blood pressure screenings.",['South LA'],Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot),"Following a series of police shootings in 2016 in Dallas and Baton Rogue, Nancy Brown, AHA's CEO, challenged us to consider what we could do to help strengthen these communities. AHAâ€™s Vice President of Advocacy Eric Batch was inspired by this challenge and the issue was brought home when his 7-year-old daughter was afraid to approach a police officer in parking lot. â€œIt just clicked. How about we create a program where officers and community members could build relationships, create a dialogue and get exercise,â€ Batch said. His timing was perfect as LAPD had approval to provide ten dedicated officers in Jackie Tatum Harvard Park through its Community Safety Partnership.
 
 
 
 Community residents who were at first hesitant to participate in the walks are now appearing every week. One resident was leery of doing things with police officers and said so. With a little coaxing he walked a lap. He enjoyed the conversation so much that he ended up walking three laps that first day out.
 
 
 
 Itâ€™s also valuable to the police officers who are taking part. Officer Marcus Whitehead wandered over to one of the health screenings area one Saturday and decided to take his blood pressure. At only 34 years old, it was surprising when his numbers came in dangerously high 160/130. As a result, he went to his doctor and began making healthy lifestyle changes. â€œThis program was set up to be beneficial for the community, but it helps us officers as well. If it wasnâ€™t for STEPS, I may have never known my situation. Iâ€™m proof that it works,â€ said Whitehead.","We are submitting this proposal as a singular organization, but we will partner with the following organizations:

 The Harvard Park neighborhood is diverse. Latinos account for two-thirds of residents with African Americans making up another third. Compared to other parts of LA county, this community is disproportionately at risk for cardiovascular diseases through increased incidence of obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes.
 
 
 
 The successful collaboration between AHA, LAPD, and the LA Department of Parks and Recreation has created a safe place to talk, get active, and learn how to live a healthier life at Harvard Park. While our program has structured walks twice a month, community members are out walking now every day of the week! Over the next year, weâ€™ll build on this success by adding structural components to continue incentives for the neighborhood to participate.
 
 
 
 Adjacent communities are so excited about this program that they have requested we bring similar programs to their neighborhoods. With additional funding weâ€™ll expand Community STEPS to South Park, the next site to be a part of LAPDâ€™s Community Safety Partnership.
 
 
 
 Activities for next year:
 
 New Park: Working with the LAPD, weâ€™ll expand to South Park, located just less than 3 miles away from Harvard Park, east of Highway 110 in South LA. Weâ€™ll hold a kickoff event at South Park and a second-year anniversary event at Harvard Park, followed by the implementation and continuation of our successful biweekly walking program at each site.
 
 
 
 Biweekly Health Activities: In addition to walking programs, weâ€™ll incorporate biweekly and monthly health events at both locations to include such things as blood pressure, cholesterol and BMI screenings, guest speakers, and themed events.
 
 
 
 Staff: To ensure the program is facilitated biweekly across multiple locations, weâ€™ll add two part-time staff to coordinate activities between community members and agency partners.
 
 
 
 Marketing: We'll use earned media including social media and targeted outreach. Weâ€™ll incorporate professional videography and photography at our events such as the Go Hoop Day (basketball), Skate Jam (skateboarding), Turkey Giveaway, bike events and others.
 
 
 
 Incentives: To encourage ongoing participation in the program and reward milestones for participants weâ€™ll provide various incentives including logo merchandise, t-shirts, water bottles, and pedometers/fitness trackers.

 ""Me and my four children, for three weeks, were living on the streets of Los Angeles with no resources, with nowhere to go. That was the most challenging period of my life.""
 
 
 
 A few years ago, Angela was evicted from her apartment in Los Angeles due to mismanagement. For three weeks she and her four children stayed in motels, slept on buses, trains and anywhere they could find to simply stay out of the cold. ""That was the biggest challenge of my life. For a mom not to be able to provide a roof over her kids' head. But I had to keep striving, and I had to be strong."" One night, while sleeping at Union Station, a group of police officers offered to help. They brought her to Union Rescue Mission. 
 
 
 
 After four months of living at the downtown emergency shelter, they were transferred to Hope Gardens Family Center, ""a land of hope,"" recalls Angela, ""I found serenity here, I found my healing."" Through the recovery program, Angela was able to heal from past traumas of domestic violence, financial crisis, and broken relationships. Her kids returned to school and have the chance to live in a healthy, nurturing environment that every child deserves. ""When I look at my kids now, I see happiness, I see contentment,"" Angela says. 
 
 
 
 After graduating from the program, Angela enrolled in the apprenticeship program at Hope Gardens and has a desire to help women and children recover from domestic violence. She is currently training for full-time employment and continues to live at Hope Gardens with her children.

932393220,Homeboy Industries,"Homeboy provides hope, training, and support to formerly gang-involved and previously incarcerated individuals allowing them to redirect their lives and become contributing members of society.","Formerly gang-involved and previously incarcerated individuals face unique challenges, including civil injunctions, visible tattoos, and criminal records that can make it difficult to get a job or enroll in education. In addition, when men and women walk through the doors of Homeboy Industries, most have few resources beyond the clothes on their back and a desire to change. Most clients have experienced complex trauma, and many are dealing with issues including substance abuse that must be addressed for transformation and economic stability. 
 
 
 
 Homeboyâ€™s overarching goal is to see individuals heal from trauma, allowing them to redirect their lives and become contributing members of the Los Angeles community. The more clients engage in their own healing and growth, the readier they are to retain a job. Homeboyâ€™s therapeutic community, re-entry services and social enterprise model aims to reduce recidivism, facilitate foundational healing, and remove barriers to employment. To this end, Homeboyâ€™s has over 30 staff and volunteer therapists, a menu of over 50 classes, and legal services who help clients along their journey of addressing intergenerational cycles of poverty and violence. Many clients and graduates remain close to the Homeboy community for continued support toward success and reduced recidivism. 
 
 
 
 Homeboy continues to create employment opportunities for the formerly incarcerated. At the end of the 18-month program, participants are placed in employment either with Homeboyâ€™s social enterprises or with an outside employer. In this way, Homeboy is both a transitional job program and a bridge employer for a great majority of its clients. Homeboy relies on partnerships in the Los Angeles community to help remove barriers to employment. 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Homeboyâ€™s employment partners currently include: IBEW, Ironworkers Union, Traylor Brothers, Interior Removal Specialists, Weber Metals, WorkSource Centers, Beanfields, and many others.
 
 â€¢ Training partners include: GRID Alternatives, Creation World Safety, Project 180, Healthright 360, East L.A. Skills Center, St. Josephâ€™s Center, St. Johnâ€™s Well Child and Family Medical Center, and Reignite Hope 
 
 â€¢ Educational partners include: Cerritos College, East Los Angeles College, L.A. Trade Tech College, Learning Works, Pasadena Unified School District, Children's Institute, Inc., and Peace Over Violence
 
 
 
 Homeboy regularly advocates around issues directly affecting the formerly incarcerated, such as Californiaâ€™s Prop. 47 (which redefined six felonies as misdemeanors) and L.A.â€™s â€œBan the Boxâ€ initiative (which prevents employers from asking about an applicantâ€™s criminal history until making a conditional job offer). Homeboy is proud of the legislative accomplishments in California, but there is still work to be done.","Established over 30 years ago, Homeboy Industries is the largest gang rehabilitation program in the world. Homeboyâ€™s healing-focused model continues to be unique in its comprehensive programming. Additionally, nearly 40% of Homeboyâ€™s full-time professional staff began as clients and were promoted from within, giving Homeboy unparalleled cultural competence in its work.
 
 
 
 Los Angeles County remains the gang capital of the nation, with an estimated 100,000 gang members. Los Angeles County is also home to the nationâ€™s largest jail system. According to Mayor Garcettiâ€™s Office of Reentry, over 163,000 individuals pass through our county jail system and more than 45,000 people are paroled to LA County each year. With this many Angelenos impacted by the justice system, removing barriers to employment for the formerly incarcerated and justice-involved is a crucial issue for the Los Angeles community. As the re-entry field in Los Angeles County grows, there are many important organizations serving the massive amount of need. Homeboy industries serves those often deemed as â€œleast likely to succeed,â€ serving a niche target population in the Los Angeles re-entry community.","Homeboy measures success in terms of services provided, training and job placements made, and outcomes in key areas that indicate healing: recidivism, social connectedness, substance abuse, and family reunification. Steps toward completing goals on an individualâ€™s service plan, however small or big, are some of our clientsâ€™ greatest successes. Social enterprise training and other outside employment tracks help clients successfully transition from â€œprogram participantâ€ to â€œemployee.â€
 
 
 
 Homeboy served over 300 clients in the 18-month program during 2018, and nearly 8,000 additional clients through free a la carte services such as classes and substance abuse support. Toward sustainable employment, Homeboyâ€™s program helps clients gain as many industry-recognized trainings and certifications as possible such as forklift, food safety and welding. Last year, Homeboy helped over 100 clients find employment and continues to build new career pathways in fields including construction, social services, and manufacturing.
 
 
 
 Outcomes for the LA2050 grant period include:
 
 - At least 300 men and women will be offered transitional employment and training through Homeboyâ€™s 18-month re-entry program
 
 - At least 100 clients and graduates will placed in outside employment
 
 - An estimated 30 individuals will be enrolled in college 
 
 - An average of 250 therapy sessions will be attended per month 
 
 
 
 The truest measure of Homeboyâ€™s success is that for 30 years, gang members keep showing up every day looking for help to get out of the gang lifestyle. Our impact is evident in each life transformed and in the growing Homeboy movement.","Work readiness trainer- $50,000

As one of many employment training tracks, these two men joined the solar panel program which provides an opportunity for program participants to gain marketable skills in a growing field. 
 
 
 
 Ignacio was released from prison with nothing but his clothes. During his first week at Homeboy, Ignacioâ€™s case manager helped him get his birth certificate, ID and social security card. From here, Ignacio was so motivated to find employment that he joined a work cohort only a few months into his time at Homeboy. He says Homeboy helped him realize, â€œmy record doesnâ€™t have to keep me back.â€ He shares that he now has â€œbetter life perspective and help for his future.â€ Ignacio now has promising job opportunities in the field of solar panel installation. 
 
 
 
 When Tyrone was released from jail, he tried to get a job at Walmart. While he got an initial job offer, he did not pass the background check. When this happened, he knew it was time to see how Homeboy could help. Tyrone shares, â€œ[Homeboy] helped me find a space to reflect on why I kept going back to jail. I usually follow down an easy path and this leads me to trouble.â€ Unless he changed his decisions, he knew his path would lead to jail again. 
 
 
 
 When Tyrone began the solar panel training, he did not like that it felt like school but he soon realized he enjoyed the work. Tyrone hopes to study psychology because he often finds himself counseling his friends and family. Still, heâ€™s discouraged to know that even if he gets a degree, his criminal record will limit his job options in the field. Tyrone now knows that he can come to Homeboy for free tutoring and eventually hopes to reduce his felony to a misdemeanor with help from our legal department.

According to Mayor Garcettiâ€™s Office of Reentry, it has been estimated that as many as 90% of formerly incarcerated Californians are unemployed at any given time. Homeboy Industries works to remove barriers to employment for previously incarcerated and formerly gang-involved individuals who are often deemed unemployable as a result of lack of skills and experience and/or discrimination. The Homeboy community provides a space to learn soft skills important to succeeding in a job, facilitates workforce training, and walks with clients as they heal from complex trauma.

As soon a client enters Homeboyâ€™s program, they are assigned a Case Manager and Navigator tasked with walking with them through the program. Each participant creates an individual service plan with their Case Manager that acts as a road map toward their personal and professional goals. After 60 days in the program, all participants begin attending a Work Readiness class that teaches customer service, work behavior, and more.

We will train teachers to provide diverse learning environments, dignity in the classroom, and equal access to college education for all students.","['Central LA', 'Our project has an LA beginning and will then reach teachers nationwide.']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"In 2005, Larchmont Charter School was founded by a group of parents who refused to stand by and allow their public schools to falter. They drew upon the professional and cultural resources of their diverse Los Angeles neighborhoods (primarily Hollywood, West Hollywood, Larchmont, and Koreatown) to build a community of engaged and committed families. Now in its 14th year, and successfully scaled up to serve students K-12, the school has responded to the academic needs of its community to become one of the leading public schools in the city (and state.) Further, Larchmont recognizes the importance of academics, social/emotional learning, and behavioral factors for all grades. The schoolâ€™s constructivist philosophy dictates that every child has a right to build upon his/her/their strengths, and each classroom is a collective of individual learners, not a group that can be instructed to median standards. This requires intensive attention from our educators. In the younger grades, we developed tools to assist teachers in this effort, such as the Whole-Child Check In, where faculty can track student performance in academics and social-emotional learning based on factors beyond test scores--factors that may include learning differences related to cultural differences. This Whole-Child Check In has scaled to our 6th grade, but more work is needed to adapt it developmentally and culturally to the secondary campus.
 
 
 
 For the Whole-Child scaling to be successful, our educators must understand that their studentsâ€™ cultural norms may be different from their own. We seek to educate our faculty about systemized classroom management plans and initiatives, such as eco-literacy and school-wide anti-bullying programs and then build and codify systems for our educators to be aware of how their own unconscious biases may create obstacles for equity in the classroom, and that their studentsâ€™ awareness of such issues may vary widely.

Educators, leaders, and board members of Larchmont Charter School believe that every child arrives with different cultural influences and deserves the right to progress with through systems of inclusion rather than systems that discriminate against minorities, those with learning differences, language barriers, or the effects of poverty. All students are met respectfully in our classrooms, with curriculum appropriate for their level, but the need for a strategic, articulated, codified system citing how educators assess each learner, at all grade levels and across four geographically and demographically different campuses and then how educators will offer each student the appropriate universal design for instruction are the core goals this grant will allow us to achieve. We seek to provide this tool not only to our own faculty but also to other educators of diverse groups of students who seek the success this model allows for their own learning communities.
 
 
 
 The Larchmont Model Teacher Initiative will develop the elements of the model and train current faculty. It will then further scale the model for success K-12. Once the model is fully documented, a plan to educate other teachers nationwide in how to implement the model will begin. We respectfully request funding from The Goldhirsh Foundation to embark on a 2-year plan to codify our system and educate as many teachers as possible, starting with those in Los Angeles. This plan allows both Larchmont Charter School and Los Angeles to be leaders in this field, and help define a progressive system of diverse-by-design education that succeeds, especially in assisting students from low-income families, students with learning differences and special needs, and English learners.

There is also a lack of green space and shaded areas on LAUSD elementary school grounds.
 
 
 
 As part of the LAUSD 2019 agreement between the United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) and LAUSD, a Green Space Task Force will be established, comprised of representatives from LAUSD, UTLA, and the City of Los Angeles. The initial goal of the task force is to present a plan to increase green space to the Board of Education by December 1, 2019, with the first priority being schools with no green space and not located near any parks, which are our current CSP program sites.
 
 
 
 RAP, along with the Los Angeles Parks Foundation (LAPF) is seeking funders to assist with not only the CSP program but to also create green spaces and inviting atmospheres on CSP campuses for the community. RAP has identified 10 additional schools in high park-need areas and are currently reaching out to those Principals to join the CSP program. Adding the Mobile Recreation Program to the current CSP sites will entice principals, children and their families to be part of the CSP program and come to the school yards on weekends or during school breaks to participate in fun recreational activities.
 
 
 
 While RAP continues to pursue the acquisition and development of new parks in high park-need neighborhoods, additional partnerships and strategies must also be pursued in order to address inequities. It is estimated that over 1 million acre-hours may be available for recreational uses at LAUSD play yards, that are currently locked during weekends, holidays and summer. RAPâ€™s enhancement of the CSP program with the Mobile Recreation Program will increase the number of families and youth visiting the CSP sites. Following implementation of these enhancements, RAP will continue to work with LAUSD to explore the financial and human resources needed to scale the program to numerous additional schools throughout the City.","When you Google â€œmobile recreationâ€, there are a few cities that have a similar program where they have recreational supplies in a van that are brought to different sites around their community. However, the majority of those include the standard sports, arts and crafts, or table games.

These 2 highly specialized vehicles are a model that we refer to often to show the successes of bringing programs to youth and families that are not able to venture far from home.","Success for the Mobile Recreation Program will be defined by the increase in attendance and repeat attendance at the current CSP sites, as well as healthy active youth. These benefits will show the CSP programs success which will assist with investors to create green spaces and convince Principals to agree to open up their school yards to the CSP program during non-school days. Success can be measured by comparing attendance at CSP sites currently with days that the Mobile Recreation vehicle is on site. It can also be measured by the addition of new CSP sites due to the success of the Mobile Recreation Program, which will provide more access to open space and recreational activities.

Structured recreation programming was not provided at the inception. RAP rolled out pop-up recreational activities last summer to improve community involvement and to increase interest and participation at the CSP sites. The activities demonstrated a benefit to the community and RAP will be launching a Mobile Recreation Program to expand the successful piloted program. Vehicles will be purchased and stocked with supplies to bring themed activities to these sites. Themed vehicles may include Sports: basketball, volleyball, soccer, archery; Dance/Music/Theatre: dance, sing, or perform a routine; Ecology: learn about plants, animals, and the environment; Arts & Crafts: learn woodworking, sewing, or making things with different materials; Cinema: learn to DJ or create animation; STEM/Robotics: integrate mechanical, electronics, technology, math, and science; or Recreation: recreational play with parachute games, giant jenga, board games, ping pong, jump rope, hopscotch. When launching the new program, there will be marketing efforts with CSP schools and surrounding communities including banners, printed flyers for students, attendance at community meetings and school PTA meetings, and postings on social media and sites such as Nextdoor.
 
 
 
 CSP sites are in communities that do not have a park within a 10-minute walk from their home. According to the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s 2017 American Community Survey, the total number of children under 18 residing in the zip codes of the four CSP schools is 56,255, with the average ethnicities of the four communities being 55.8% Latino, 21.0% Asian, 11.1% African-American, 10.2% Caucasian, and 1.9% Other.
 
 
 
 RAPâ€™s goal is to purchase and stock the first vehicle for this program by summer 2019 utilizing the current CSP budget. The LA2050 grant would assist with funding a second themed vehicle and supplies. These mobile recreation vehicles would rotate among the CSP schools on weekends and school breaks; beginning Fall 2019 they could expand to being utilized for after school programs and future CSP schools, as well as pocket parks that have no recreational programming.
 
 
 
 According to the Trust for Public Land, 39% of residents in the City of Los Angeles do not live within a ten minute walk or Â½ mile from a park. Los Angeles has disparities in access to quality open space, recreation programs, and facilities, which have been found to disproportionately impact low income communities and communities of color. Opening LAUSD playgrounds on the weekend was the first step to creating access to open spaces in needed communities. Adding a Mobile Recreation Program to the CSP sites will create access to recreational and social activities that will attract children and families to join the fun and stay active.",Active,PLAY,Under Review,,Moderation Process,

The network will be autonomous, and so the antennas can be owned by anyone.","The FCC. Even though we will only use radios that they have already approved, we will be using them with a switching protocol that they don't know about. They will want us to stop because they're always going to side with the big mobile carriers, when they should be siding with the public to keep the Net a level playing field. The carrier business model is based upon scarcity so that they can create service classes, whereas our business model is based upon abundance, ending the Net Neutrality debate. This is why we will not own the base station antenna hardware, just like Uber doesn't own the cars. Of course, this lowers our operating expenses dramatically versus other networks, but more importantly, when they tell us to shut it down we simply won't be able to because we don't control the hardware and the network is managed autonomously between the base stations...there is no middle of a network to shut down. 
 
 
 
 If this were any other market, it may not matter as much, but there is a reason that telecommunications needs to be controlled by a public utility once again...because it supports every person, every business and every connected thing. We will use the strategy that the City of LA used for trash collection, when they realized that it didn't make sense to have multiple trash collectors sharing residential streets. The same is true for our publicly-owned wireless airwaves, which are being shared by multiple carriers who would like to roll out tens of thousands of micro-cells. There has been no five year study, so we are the 5G experiment, and so we have very little understanding of the full relationship between EMF pollution and neurological disorders (just google the terms EMF + Autism).
 
 
 
 Outside of the US, the implication for developing countries is that a ruling party will not be able to shut down the Net or inhibit people from organizing, which ultimately improves our own national security. This is why we will publish all of our reference designs for M2M Bell solutions. It doesn't matter to us who builds and sells the antennas because our business model depends upon the devices. But even if it didn't, it would still make sense to let others copy us because more antennas with near perfect efficiency is ultimately better for society than twice as many inefficient antennas doing the same amount of work.","There are other long range IoT networks that will use the same FCC-approved antennas that we will use. They are The Things Network, Sigfox and of course, the mobile and satellite carriers. They project connectivity charges that range from $6 to $2 per year per device. So at what point does Internet of Things connectivity just become included? M2M Bell will not have connectivity charges, nor could we legally in unlicensed airwaves. We will charge the companies that make devices a 1% licensing fee when they include our technology in their communications chip. Legacy devices will also connect for free, creating a seamless migration path. Going forward, OEMs will want to embed the technology to remain competitive, so their newer devices will perform much better, not to mention that they'll be selling their ""thing"" with with a lifetime of connectivity included. Our simulations have also shown that another result of the power reduction, is that a device with energy harvesting could run forever. This is called ""perpetual data collection"" which will become very important in structural engineering. 
 
 Finally, antenna base station partners will be compensated with a revenue share, based upon traffic and cloud hosting. This is similar to cryptocurrency data miners, who will probably be some our first antenna hosts, helping us displace the credit card terminal network. None of our competitors have a technology that will allow for a mesh/star hybrid network, where the network gets stronger with more devices and traffic. Their networks will use the standard, running at maximum 50% efficiency when conditions are perfect, and our network will run at 98% efficiency at all times, using half the power per bit transferred.","When our first antenna goes live on campus, the other USC tech teams can run their applications within our attached servers. We will then approach the City as a founding member of the i3 Consortium, because the i3 platform is the open data exchange being developed at USC as the City's IoT platform. Verizon is also in the Consortium, so beating them to the punch in Los Angeles would be a fine measure of success...and of course, they too, can use our technology in their antenna base stations.
 
 
 
 Any legacy device using the network would also be considered a success, because that will be the first step to showing OEMs (and the semiconductor companies they buy from), that our technology needs to be embedded in their devices. Consumers and device companies will ultimately find more and more uses for anything that is free and can't be shut down.

 The patented technology we've developed has won IEEE and a Google Research Awards after demonstrations in Barcelona and Philadelphia. Now we need to complete the coding, adding rules for mobility, and rules for devices people already own. We need WiFi research hardware, as well as the hardware that will create the first base station antennas at USC, the LA Chamber and the LA Cleantech Incubator.","['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"I grew up in northern New Jersey where my dad was an AT&T executive, so I knew all of the reasons that the phone company existed as a public utility. Customer proprietary network information (CPNI) is still the law of the land but unfortunately, the Trump FCC reversed the Obama FCC's Title II decision that would have made the law applicable to data networks. Regardless, M2M Bell can and will enforce our telecommunications laws because we will be the first packet network which can perform at the quality level of the old telephone networks, which never had security and performance issues because of the Quality of Service (QoS) between the Central Office and our homes
 
 . 
 
 To date, unfortunately, the only lives that have been impacted positively are the ones which have completed the previous research, where they won awards from the Spanish government, as well as from Alcatel and Vodafone. This helped those engineers get better jobs, or go onto better schools...like Zhang who is now at Stanford after winning awards for demonstrating our technology when he was at Bucknell. 
 
 
 
 Previous attempts to commercialize the technology included three presentations to the Silicon Valley Telecom Council. Invariably, the carriers will tell you that they're just operators and they don't make the gear. Then companies like Cisco and Juniper will tell you that it's true, they make the gear but they don't design the com chips...to be followed by Qualcomm and Broadcom, who will say, ""If it's not going through standards and if we don't own the intellectual property, then what is there to talk about?""
 
 
 
 We have also sponsored grad student internships after we got our Google Award at USC. Unfortunately, Google didn't actually come through with the WiFi hardware they'd promised, citing an FCC rule that wouldn't let their Chinese OEMs ship an unlocked chip to the US. The lives we hope to impact the most, however, are the ones not yet born. Certainly, consumers will benefit across the board, but the end goal is for the next generation to know what it means to have their devices and communications supported by privacy law...just as the US Post Office intended, long before the privacy laws crossed over to telecommunication in the 1930's.","The Marshall business school at USC has given M2M Bell a home within the Blackstone Launchpad, and has assigned a business student as our project manager.

With M2M Bell, connectivity would just be in the air like when you turn on your car radio, where connectivity is just a feature...not a separate service. For the companies that make the devices, this also becomes an advantage because they will have immediate connectivity to their cloud upon first power-up out of the box, which would be hosted on the M2M Bell network. This allows the device to ""check in"" before the consumer introduces a potentially unsafe device to every other device in their home or business. Once a device is trusted, then the consumer can decide to give it access to traditional networks, or not.
 
 
 
 The M2M Bell network also uses half the power needed to transmit data because of our proprietary switching protocol which does not transmit data packets over and over until they go through. This power reduction has far reaching benefits, including a reduction in the data center footprint, a reduction in EMF pollution, and eventually, the elimination of existing routers, which for the first time will not need to be replaced by faster ones.
 
 
 
 We will use unlicensed TV airwaves for the long distance mesh core (WiFi and LTE), while using long range Internet of Things radios (Zigbee and LoRa) for the access networks that allow ""things"" to connect. The access network also uses unlicensed airwaves, so our network is 100% wireless and does not require connectivity to wired network. 
 
 
 
 The coding that still needs to be completed utilizes a patented, award-winning technology that reduces network overhead from 50% to less than 2%. For the Bucknell demo in Philadelphia, this translated into the antenna's ability to improve capacity from 1500 to 5700 competing devices. We also have 5G simulations that would allow an antenna to serve 15,000 competing devices. 
 
 
 
 Once funded, the research can be completed within 3-4 months, and then we will work with other teams at USC in Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies, including USC's i3 Consortium. The i3 is like a Playstore for live data streams that can be used by the City of LA (a founding member), and the i3 would also be hosted on the M2M Bell network. After 6-8 months, the first antennas will go up for Downtown LA, followed by the City and County.
 
 
 
 M2M Bell will be the first wireless data network that gets stronger as it gets larger, because each new device does not add overhead...this is the inverse of today's switching technology. Our patented technology was originally invented for cable TV, so broadcasting voice and video will be the future applications after the Internet of Things applications. 
 
 
 
 M2M Bell will be the first wireless data network that can enforce telecommunications harassment, obscenity and privacy laws, which stipulate that all data created by our ""things"" is owned by us.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,

Securing company partners to host summer interns is one of the most challenging, but critical aspect of the programâ€™s development. Companies are concerned that they do not have enough funding to make even a nominal company contribution or capacity to train or supervise interns. Recruiting industry partners is a time-intensive and trust building process.
 
  
 
 Our strategy for addressing the challenge is to begin company recruitment earlier and to make a stronger case to companies for how interns provide valuable support in testing and development, allowing company leaders to spend their time on high value-add activities that can help their enterprise grow. We are also developing an internship planning toolkit for companies of all sizes to use with examples for internship projects, templates for agreements, onboarding an intern, interviewing candidates, sourcing suitable candidates for internship.","While there are several entrepreneurship programs available for young adults, there are none that focus on the bioscience industry and target students of color. Biotech is a unique field and creating a company in this industry looks very different from other sectors. Our program recognizes this and provides a specialized set of modules that address the industry-specific challenges and aims to inspire and prepare students to create companies that address some of our worldâ€™s most pressing issues.
 
 
 
 Local biotech executives do not reflect LA's demographics. Research shows that students from low-income communities are less aware of the bio-entrepreneurship pathway, perpetuating under-representation of certain groups in industry leadership. BLA entrepreneurship training is especially valuable for community college students who may not have the same social network and exposure as four-year college or higher-income students.
 
 
 
 Our internship placement program is also unique in the perspective and opportunity it provides for community college students. students. Community colleges are full of talented, well-prepared students. However, when competing with students from LAâ€™s many universities, community college students are often over-looked for internships. This is a problem because community college students are more likely to come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, and the reduced access to opportunities creates another obstacle to attaining economic mobility.","Biotech Leaders Academy aims to 1) increase student awareness of and confidence in biotech entrepreneurship and diverse career pathways 2) improve access to professional networks 3) strengthen student resumes with paid, academically relevant experience, and 4) increase industry and company awareness of community college talent.

 Students have shared that by seeing themselves reflected in the diverse set of guest speakers in the entrepreneurship academy, they were affirmed in their future career goals â€“ some broadening their view of opportunities, and some reinforcing their specific interests.
 
 
 
 In addition to elevating talented students and giving them tools to flourish in the field, Biotech Leaders Academy supports the growth and success of bioscience start-ups â€“ which we want to see be successful here in LA. One of our company partners was apprehensive when we first approached them. When they worked with one of our students, they were so impressed that they asked to have two interns the following year.

With its growing presence in Los Angeles, LABH is working towards the longer-term vision of a biotech industry where the workforce and leadership reflects LAâ€™s diversity. Biotech Leaders Academy (BLA) is a 10-week summer program with two components: (1) an entrepreneurship academy and (2) paid internships in the biotech field. 
 
 
 
 The entrepreneurship academy exposes students from diverse backgrounds to the spectrum of career pathways and helps them understand the power and potential of their bioscience-related degree. We cultivate LAâ€™s next generation of local bioscience company founders, CEOs, COOs, and CTOs. We foster entrepreneurship through learning modules that cover a variety of topics, including tech transfer, moving research from the lab to commercialization, securing capital, and building a team for success. Students meet local entrepreneurs and get connected to networks and resources to ensure their success here in LA.
 
 
 
 The second component of BLA is our summer internship placement. We pair students with paid industry internships at growing biotech companies to provide them hands-on work experience in this competitive field. LABH and participating biotech companies jointly fund student compensation, ensuring meaningful industry engagement and enabling a broad spectrum of firms to participate.
 
 
 
 BLA is designed to serve diverse students who are students of color, immigrants, women, and/or from low-income communities. These populations are prominent in Los Angeles economy and culture yet are not reflected in the growing biotech industryâ€™s leadership. We ensure that our programâ€™s opportunity is reaching our target demographics by partnering with each community college's Math, Engineering, and Science Achievement (MESA) program, which supports students from populations underrepresented in STEM.

1575645112,Cardborigami,Cardborigami provides instant space to protect people from the elements through innovation and design. We connect displaced populations using our emergency shelter product to local service providers.,"One major challenge we know we may face is how various municipal agencies may interpret the applicability of their emergency shelter ordinance to these pilots. Existing codes have for the most part been written with only indoor, physical buildings in mind. They specify requirements for things like HVAC systems which would not apply to alternatives like ours. 
 
 
 
 What we have already been doing to minimize the potential incongruence is meeting with staff in LA City Planning, for example, to raise the need to update the ordinance so new
 
 solutions will not be excluded just by sheer fact of not using a permanent structure. 
 
 
 
 A source of opposition may be community members who are against any pop-up that could be situated near them. We plan to calm potential NIMBYism by using supportive Neighborhood Council members who can educate & engage these folks in civic dialogue.","Safe Parking LA (https://www.safeparkingla.org) is working to pilot safe parking lots around LA that would host those who are homeless and living out of their vehicles. The obvious difference between their effort and ours is the possession and usage of a vehicle for shelter. The clients they aim to serve risk criminalization for sleeping in their cars/vans at night, so SPLA is looking to link them with parking lots where they may legally park & sleep. We consider SPLA complementary as they are advocating for similar land use repurposing, to be open during emergency shelter hours (sundown to sunrise), and our leaders are in contact and have discussed future potential to work together. LA County's vehicular homeless make up about 25% of the unsheltered population, so there is still a full 50%+ without cars

Furthermore, the number of vehicles, tents and makeshift shelters has increased 32% since 2016. Considering these trends, Cardborigami intends to shift the paradigm on what an emergency shelter can look like, where it can be located, and how it can better serve and maintain dignity for those experiencing homelessness. 
 
 
 
 Emergency shelters are traditionally conceived as physical buildings within which people are aggregated into open sleeping arrangements. Two main problems of this approach:
 
 brick-and-mortar facilities cannot be built or converted fast enough to meet the need, and mixing strangers in an â€˜open-corralâ€™ type environment can elevate anxieties. Instead of limiting the format of such shelter to permanent structures, we can reimagine how to use existing, underutilized spaces that can serve multiple uses, including as sites for temporary, quickly deployable shelter. Our shelters have been used in post-disaster situations domestically and internationally to assist residents with recovery and rebuilding, and we believe there is similar application to our local homelessness crisis.
 
 
 
 Our target population encompasses unsheltered homeless who do not have access to safe, local shelter within reasonable reach by transit; those who have difficulty accessing services due to locational instability; those who decline traditional shelters; and those who need to fill a gap in availability transitioning between shelter stages. 
 
 
 
 While our pop-up sites will be open to the range of those fitting this description, we intend to organize the sites based on compatible sub-populations in consultation with partner service agencies. A personâ€™s physical mobility to utilize a Cardborigami in comfort will also be considered. We are keenly interested in being an option for the first-time homeless, who may not be prioritized for shelter versus the chronically homeless, and who could benefit greatly from avoiding exposure to trauma in existing shelter settings.
 
 
 
 Over the course of 6 to 8 months, at pilots operating consecutively at 2 different sites averaging 20-25 shelters per site, or an equivalent capacity within a 12-month timeframe using smaller sets of shelters spread across more sites, we plan to serve a minimum of 100 distinct individuals.
 
 
 
 Quantitatively, our effectiveness will be seen in:
 
 -Reduction in costs vs traditional emergency shelter 
 
 -Number of homeless clients who are continuously followed in case management for the duration of their stay
 
 -Clientsâ€™ accelerated progress along the shelter spectrum towards permanent supportive housing
 
 
 
 Qualitative impact will be evidenced by:
 
 -Clientsâ€™ improvement in feelings of self-worth and agency
 
 -Increase in positive engagements between clients and the local community",,Active,LIVE,,,Voting Period,

Additionally we will elevate both key information on the needs of foster youth, as well as first-hand stories from foster youth and families from the recent California wildfires.","The recent, devastating natural disasters that have affected LA County have spurred many organizations to engage in efforts to make the community more prepared. However, Children Now, in partnership with Social Change Partners, are focused on the unique needs of children in foster care and their caregivers during times of natural disaster â€“ a critical issue that no other disaster preparedness effort is focused on. We are uniquely positioned to lead a campaign to improve disaster relief efforts impacting foster youth and families. We have an unparalleled ability to create partnerships across the agencies that need to be engaged on this issue and to build a broad base of support for this issue. We already actively and regularly engage with well over 3,500 organizations across California. This includes3,000+ members of The Childrenâ€™s Movement â€“ a membership base coordinated by Children Now of direct service, business, civil rights, parent, student, faith-based, and community groups working on behalf of kidsâ€™ wellbeing â€“ across the state. More than 650 Childrenâ€™s Movement members are located in LA County. We will leverage our relationships and connections with stakeholders and local groups to work to improve access to essential resources and services for LA youth in foster care and their caregivers immediately following a disaster.","Children Nowâ€™s ultimate goal is to ensure LA foster children and youth have access to the supports, services, and resources they need to maintain appropriate placements, to thrive academically, and to stabilize following a natural disaster. Our key objective for this activation is to raise public and policymaker awareness about the impact of natural disasters on child welfare system-involved children, youth, and families in LA in order to strengthen disaster planning processes and improve the fiscal infrastructure to better address their needs following a disaster. For this project, we will measure our success by the following metrics:
 
 
 
 - Number of policymakers representing LA that are educated about the post-disaster needs of foster children and families.
 
 
 
 - Number of LA stakeholders and partners informed by Children Now on the post-disaster needs of foster children and families.
 
 
 
 - Number of LA Childrenâ€™s Movement organizational and individual members that are educated about the impact of natural disasters on children and families involved with the child welfare system.
 
 
 
 - Production and distribution of communications materials on the impact of natural disasters on children and families involved in with the child welfare system.
 
 
 
 - Estimated social media reach on impact of natural disasters on children and families involved with the child welfare system.","CHILDREN NOW PROJECT BUDGET:

Children Now is aiming to improve access to essential resources and services for youth in foster care and their caregivers immediately following a disaster. This project will ensure that LA communities and the state are well-prepared to support foster youth and foster parents following a disaster.",['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)'],Lateral application (testing feasibility of a proven action/solution to a new issue or sector),"Californiaâ€™s kids face very real structural barriers to their abilities to thrive. It is critical to tear down these barriers and provide the supports vulnerable children need to reach their full potentials. Children Nowâ€™s model was developed with the goal of transforming childrenâ€™s advocacy by breaking down the siloes that exist in the field and creating a stronger, coordinated base of support for policies that can do just that.
 
 
 
 When children are abused and neglected and cannot safely remain at home, they enter foster care and the state assumes the legal and moral obligation to ensure their safety, stability and success. To help them heal from the significant trauma they have experienced, these vulnerable children must be placed in stable family homes with nurturing caregivers and have access to critical supports and services. Far too often, however, they experience multiple placement changes, sometimes being placed in institutions, as well as barriers accessing the very supports they need to thrive. This can have lifelong impacts, leading to poor emotional, social and academic outcomes.
 
 
 
 We use our whole-child model to get kids in foster care the supports they need. For example, lack of access to affordable child care often prevented caregivers, many of whom work, from opening their homes to our youngest foster children or led them to ask for the children in their care to be moved to a new home. In 2017, Children Now, working collaboratively with both child care and child welfare partners, successfully established the Emergency Child Care Bridge Program for Foster Children to provide emergency vouchers for foster families to immediately access child care, navigators to help families find long-term child care, and training for child care providers on meeting the needs of abused and neglected children. 
 
 
 
 The program has positively impacted families like Anne, Thomas and Gabriel. With Bridge Program support, Anne and Thomas secured child care for Gabriel soon after he was placed with them and continue working. Their Navigator helped them learn how to find long-term child care to meet Gabrielâ€™s unique needs. Because the family was stabilized early on, they have bonded and are moving forward with adoption.",N/A,darac@childrennow.org,Derya Arac,510-763-2444,[],[],[],[],Non-profit organization,"['Yes, in 2014', 'Yes, in 2015', 'Yes, in 2016', 'Yes, in 2018']",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://www.facebook.com/childrennow/,@childrennow,@ChildrenNow,https://www.https://www.childrennow.org,,['LA2050 newsletter'],21-50 employees,No,,[],[],['Resilient communities'],['LA is the healthiest place to CONNECT'],Los Angeles,"1714 W.

Foster homes and transitional housing units have been evacuated, damaged, and/or permanently destroyed, displacing foster children and parents. These children and families have struggled to have their basic needs met while they have been displaced, often lacking reliable access to housing, food, and clothing. Lastly, children and families have had to temporarily relocate far from their prior residences, forcing long and costly commutes to get to school, work, and appointments. While the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) responds to California disasters, their prolonged administrative process can take months to transition impacted families into long-term assistance programs, and too often youth and families must fend for themselves, without timely access to critical resources. 
 
 
 
 Given the inevitability of further large-scale natural disasters in the future, the State of California has a responsibility to take a leadership role in supporting community and system preparedness and ensuring that sufficient resources are immediately available to support disaster-impacted foster children and families. Over the next year, Children Now will help ensure that LA County is the best place to LIVE by being better prepared to support foster youth and their families during an emergency and post-disaster. This will be accomplished through these activities over the next year:
 
 
 
 -Partnering with state, county, and local LA leaders as well as disaster experts to develop solutions to (1) strengthen support systems for foster children and families impacted by natural disasters; (2) finance proactive, community-level disaster planning; and (3) provide concrete resources and supports to meet the needs of foster children, youth, and families.

 Using powerful examples from BLACK PANTHER, IRONHEART, and Representative John Lewis's graphic novels MARCH and RUN, as well as COCO, ONE DAY AT A TIME, ON MY BLOCK, and others, we teach resilience, healthy identity, navigating peer pressure, positive values, breaking barriers, and more, to children of color.

 Curriculum fidelity will measure whether teachers use the curriculum as its developers intended them to be used in a manner responsive to the learning objectives. The steps in assessing curriculum fidelity include:
 
 
 
 â€¢ Obtain list of key elements in the curriculum from program staff
 
 â€¢ Develop a checklist to determine whether teachers implemented the program as intended by the designers of the program
 
 â€¢ Administer the checklist online to teachers after every session
 
 â€¢ Analyze and report findings
 
 â€¢ Develop a brief questionnaire for teachers
 
 â€¢ Administer the questionnaire online each quarter
 
 â€¢ Conduct two focus groups with teachers
 
 â€¢ Analyze and report results from the questionnaire and focus groups
 
  
 
 Program impact assesses whether behavioral, programmatic, and/or policy changes can be attributed to the curriculum. The steps in assessing program impact include (for both teachers and students):
 
 
 
 â€¢ Develop an online questionnaire
 
 â€¢ Pilot test the questionnaire on a small sample of students who will not be part of the main survey
 
 â€¢ Revise the questionnaire as necessary
 
 â€¢ Administer a pretest at the beginning and a posttest at the end of the program

She realized that the issue of bullying always has the same dynamics, whether on the playground, classroom, office, relationships, gangs, or war: oppression & power imbalance.
 
 
 
 Then in 2010, she read about a 1st grader named Katie who was bullied for carrying her Star Wars lunchbox to school. All the kids told Katie she was acting like a boy. Katie loved Star Wars, but she sunk into depression and decided to abandon it -- until her Mom, Carrie Goldman, wrote a blog post, asking readers to encourage her daughter. They received thousands of messages, including Chase's. She kept in touch with Carrie and Katie.
 
 
 
 Carrie wrote a book which Harper Collins published, ""Bullied: What Every Parent, Teacher, and Kid Needs to Know About Ending the Cycle of Fear."" It won the Parenting and Mom's Choice Awards. Carrie asked Chase to help expand her work, and they formed the Coalition to end bullying, racism, misogyny, LGBTQI+bullying, and cyberbullying.

 ROOT ISSUES
 
 While bullying is epidemic, it is a symptom, not the root of the problem. The root is a lack of healthy identity in the bully, often due to issues at home. Childhood bullies become adult bullies. The cycle continues. 
 
 
 
 SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING (SEL) is the process through which children understand & manage emotions, set & achieve positive goals, feel & show empathy, establish & maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. It includes bullying prevention & provides life-long tools.
 
 
 
 Research over 20 yrs found that teaching SEL leads to: 
 
 Decreased bullying 
 
 Increased attendance & positive behavior
 
 Higher grades, test scores
 
 Admission into higher ed
 
 Quality career placement, personal/work relationships 
 
 
 
 90% of teachers & 75% of students see that SEL is crucial. It has a disproportionately high benefit for low-income students coping with add'l challenges.

The projects we offer students are created in partnership with professional artists offering deep learning experiences that are fun and developmentally rich.,['LAUSD'],Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot),"The birth of Crayon Collection is very unique as it originated from solving a systemic problem of wastefulness in America. We noticed that restaurants in America were throwing away over 150 million crayons per year. These crayons are made of paraffin wax and never decompose, damaging our precious environment. At the same time budget cuts in education left art programs to be only in well-served schools despite proof that children with access to the arts performed better in all subjects. Additionally, teachers were forced to spend their personal earnings to outfit their classroom with the most basic school supplies. The Crayon Collection was born after we asked restaurants to collect the still good crayons kid-diners left behind. Each restaurant was then paired with a local Title 1 or Head Start school who picked up an average of 2,500 per month. The schools and the restaurants were never over 5 miles apart so it was a community effort to find a new home for the crayons versus tossing them in the trash. This program then evolved in order to solve the lack of art education in schools as well because we felt that the arts should not only be for affluent children. All children have a right to use their left and right brain to learn. We began to challenge local LA artists who had a masters degree in fine arts and were represented by LA based galleries. The parameters we asked them to abide by simply to create deep art projects that were fun and interesting for children using JUST crayons as the main tool. We asked them to avoid coloring projects that were about staying ""inside the lines"" and the results were powerful. The art projects were taught during class time in LAUSD schools by the artists themselves. We won an award for our work inside the classroom by the LAUSD school board.

Then the project begins and the kids are able to express themselves in ways that are most unique as the project is created by an artist who has high education and ability to create. For example, one artist conceived Crayon Collection project uses crayons to teach a technique called ""Blind Contour Line Drawings"" through a Basquiat-esque project. Another project teaches various shading techniques by Rembrandt. Each day the students will work on a new project and have the chance to hone in on their abilities with their own pack of crayons that were donated to them but Crayon Collection. We will survey the children about their interest in the arts and their knowledge of the various techniques and artists. At the end of the month we plan to survey the students again to see what knowledge they gained from the program and whether they enjoyed it. After the project is complete the students are able to benefit from the teacher for homework assistance as well.",Active,PLAY,,,Voting Period,

However, we also see this as an opportunity. To ensure we reach our desired audience, we plan to partner with Creative Alliance platforms and media partners such as Complex, Awesomeness, MTV and more to share both organic and paid content to their audiences to drive traffic and awareness to Creator Force. This could include dual branded content, activations at events such as Complex Con and the MTV Music Awards, and providing young people access to their staff and facilities. It will be a consistent priority to strategically leverage the best partners, research, and practices for engaging a Gen Z audience.","There are many incredible organizations working with young people to bring more diversity to the Creative Class. Creator Force is unique in that it engages young people not only through awareness by helping them make the connection between the culture they consume and the jobs they can have. Creator Force is also providing them with the tools and resources to best position themselves to a career path in the Creative Class. Furthermore, a key component of our campaign is to include jobs sometimes overlooked in the creative industry - like sound mixers, UX Designers and more. We hope to engage young people who may not have previously considered a creative job, hence creating a more diverse pipeline. A sign of our success will be when the incredible organizations doing work in this space have an increase in diverse talented young people that want to join their programs.
 
 Once we hire a full time Director and Partnerships Manager, we hope to build partnerships with Best Buyâ€™s Teen Tech Center and Clubhouse Network as local partners to provide resources to young people after their initial engagement with Creator Force. We also respect the work of local organizations like 826LA, Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, and Las Fotos project ,and hope to partner with them to push out the content and connect young people interested in Creator Force with local organizations that will provide more hands-on support. We also love the work that the Bixel Exchange and Pledge LA does to change the culture of hiring and think there will be opportunities to partner with them to provide education and tools to the creative companies that partner with us.","The goal of Creator Force is to see a more diverse Creative Class. To reach that goal, we will strategically engage young people through opportunities for education, change in hiring culture, and measure awareness of jobs in the Creative Class with young people. Below are our metrics for success in year one. 
 
 -Launch initiative with a large media partner and three culturally relevant brand partners to reach millions of young people across social media 
 
 -25k CreativeLive classes taken
 
 -500k visits to our website
 
 -150 ""Get Paid for What?"" profiles on our website

 -1000 young people referred to creative nonprofit partner programs","The funding from LA2050 will enable us to hire a Partnerships Manager for one year. This person will be leading recruiting both corporate and nonprofit partners across LA. For the corporate partners, they recruit creative companies to host in-person events with youth, commit to making content and donating media. For nonprofit partners, they will build a network of organizations that we can be promoting across the Creator Force platform to recruit more students to join their program.

As part of the programming, 72andSunny has seen firsthand the impact that access to education, hands-on opportunities, and mentorship can have on high schoolers in their career journeys, whether through office tours or semester-long internships. 72andSunny knew that this kind of program could make a huge difference in the lives of teens, but through their efforts, they could only reach 50 to 80 young people a year versus the 734,641 who live in LAUSD. Already a member of the Creative Alliance, a collective of creative companies across the country who partner on civic action campaigns, 72andSunny reached out to Civic Nation in pursuit of scaling this program nationwideâ€”providing this incredible access to the Creative Class to teens across the US. Our teams joined forces in a perfect storm of experience, capacity, and passion to begin building out long-term infrastructure to fundamentally change what the Creative Class looks like. We aim to not only change the economies of the communities we work with, but to bring about a more inclusive and diversified Creative Class for a more just society. While this is just the beginning of our story, founded in LA, we hope to bring Creator Force to cities and communities nationwide, lasting for many years to come.","Creator Force is an initiative of Civic Nation.

The creative sector is only a known option to few, which is reflected in the disproportionate presence of white creatives in the industry. Creator Force will launch in LA, the global hub for creative talent, working to diversify the creative field. In addition, LAâ€™s focus to increase diversity in the Creative Class with investment by the city, corporations and nonprofits is unparalleled. 
 
 Creator Force works to drive awareness, provide inspiration and education about jobs in the Creative Class to 16-19 year olds in communities with gender and race underrepresentation in the Creative Class. These youth have never known a time without internet and mobile phones. Knowing that, we will engage them first online, specifically on social media where, on average, they login over 100 times a day. 
 
 The young people we will target face unique barriers to entering the Creative Class - first being awareness that these jobs exist. Teensâ€™ knowledge and awareness is heavily influenced by their community- parents, teachers and friends. 81% of LAâ€™s 800,000 young people (ages 10 to 24) are nonwhite but 44% of LAâ€™s Creative Class is White. This demographic imbalance implies there is limited likelihood of exposure to people in the Creative Class for young people of color. 
 
 We will leverage big moments in culture, when young people are already paying attention, to create content that drives awareness around the jobs that go into creating tentpole events and festivals, producing the next blockbuster, dropping a new design collaboration, and more. This content will be promoted organically and with large media partners.
 
 Another barrier is knowledge of how to get a creative job. Our program â€œGet Paid for What?â€ shows young people the pathways to the Creative Class which profiles of real creatives, from interns to CEOs. 
 
 The profiles will also combat the cultural perception that creative jobs are not stable and reliable. Contrarily, the Creative Class accounts for 50% of wages and 30% of jobs nationally. In California, that is $227.8 billion annually. The profiles will highlight the economic freedom these jobs provide.
 
 We will provide over 100 free CreativeLive classes on our Youtube channel ranging from Adobe Suite, lighting for film, and more. 
 
 In 2019, we will pilot on the ground activations in LA. We will partner with creative companies to open their offices for tours, workshops, and panels to help young people visualize themselves working at these companies. We will also highlight opportunities with LA nonprofits focused on the creative fields on our website and social channels. This will further connect young people with hands-on, in-person opportunities to build their skills.

2076741278,Team Rubicon,Team Rubicon unites the skills and experience of our nation's military veterans with first responders to rapidly deploy emergency response teams following natural disasters.,"Team Rubicon tackles three pressing issues: our preparedness for and ability to respond to disasters; the challenges of veterans reintegrating back into our communities; and the lack of civic engagement in communities today. The recently released Veterans Civic Health Index highlights values that are present and can be unlocked. Veterans consistently outperform civilians in volunteer hours contributed. And veterans are more apt to work with neighbors to fix community problems. By preparing for and responding to disasters, Team Rubicon provides purpose, community, and identity to our nationâ€™s transitioning veterans. TR provides a means of continuing to identify with the values inherent in a uniform; however, the beneficiary is no longer the military unit, it is the veteranâ€™s community. Team Rubicon provides a unique vehicle for veterans to give back, to serve again, and to heal, with tremendous positive impact for communities impacted by disaster.","Team Rubiconâ€™s contribution to the field is unique. Prior to the development of Team Rubicon, no other national disaster relief organization provided the range of direct services that TR provides (intelligence, command and control, volunteer management, and debris management). Team Rubicon is able to leverage the leadership training of its veterans to bring order to chaos, implement the systems necessary to process large volumes of information, develop a coherent plan of action, and then apply it. Being able to accomplish this while simultaneously providing veterans with the purpose, community and sense of identity that they need for a healthy transition solves two problems with one solution.","Team Rubicon measures our success by the impact we provide to communities impacted by natural disasters and the impact we have on local communities and volunteers preparing to serve their neighboring communities post-disaster. Team Rubicon will define success by our ability to serve more communities in need, train more volunteers, and create more resilient communities.","Team Rubicon will utilize the $100,000 of grant funds from LA2050 to support Los Angeles volunteer growth through recruitment, training, and engagement, operational funding, national and regional capacity and staff support, and shared program support throughout the country and internationally. Unrestricted funding enables Team Rubicon leaders and volunteers to prepare to serve impacted communities through consistent training in between disasters, build resilient communities, deploy rapidly to serve communities in need, respond to multiple disasters at once, respond to disasters that don't receive extensive media attention, build staff capacity at our Los Angeles headquarters and at the local level across the country, and more.

 ""EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.â€
 
 
 
 The automated emergency alert systemâ€™s synthetic voice informed homeowner Joan Heasley to find shelter elsewhere until the heavy storm had passed. [â€¦]
 
 
 
 Her home sits within the Robinhood Oaks Estates in Lake Elsinore, California, where, as of late, different disasters have threatened her quaint neighborhood.
 
 
 
 In the past six months the surrounding area was scarred by the flames of the Holy Jim Fire, followed by flash floods that ravaged the charred landscape, and then a heavy storm that triggered a torrent of mud and debris. While many may have packed their precious belongings and left for higher ground, Heasley opted to stay in her home. [â€¦]
 
 
 
 Once the storm passed through the area, Heasley examined her property and noticed that two drainage pipes nearby were completely dammed with muck. The pipes divert the creek from flowing into the streets and into homes; leaving it clogged would lead to potential hazards from the next rainstorms, causing severe damage to the Robinhood Estates neighborhood. [â€¦]
 
 
 
 â€œI saw this gentleman keep walking up and down the creek and then he saw me,â€ she recalls. â€œI heard him say, â€˜we are going to come and help you!'â€
 
 
 
 Hesitant at first, Heasley took the brochure from the Greyshirt and saw the name Team Rubicon on it.
 
 
 
 â€œThis is amazing!â€ exclaimed Heasley. â€œItâ€™s really absolutely amazing because up until now I tried my hardest I could [to clean up] and spent thousands of dollars that I couldnâ€™t afford.â€
 
 
 
 Team Rubicon sent a small forward strike team to the Robinhood Estate neighborhood ahead of the Operation Wind Rider start date. Their purpose was to make ready the area for the soon arriving heavy equipment and to clear out the two drainage pipes. Heasley watched as the 11 Greyshirts with shovels and sleds manually moved dirt and rock out of the two 32-foot-long drainage pipes.
 
 
 
 â€œI saw smiles on these men and women as they worked,â€ said Heasley. â€œIâ€™m just totally amazed!

2132049121,Rise,Rise is a student-led nonprofit working to ensure that all students can earn a higher education by advocating for policies that make public higher education free.,"One major challenge we anticipate facing is a hesitation of students who are experiencing homelessness and food insecurity to come forward. As there is a great deal of stigma associated with homelessness and food insecurity, some might be hesitant to speak out about their personal experiences or show up to public Rise-sponsored events about enrolling in CalFresh for example.
 
 
 
 In addition to calling on our past experience and success working with and empowering students from a broad range of backgrounds, our campaign messaging will aim to de-stigmatize student homelessness and food insecurity, making campus, and especially the Rise community, a safe space for students to come together and solve some of the biggest challenges they are facing together.","Rise has two principal groups of competitors. The first group is progressive organizations that invest in campus organizing. The second group is higher education policy and research organizations focused on college affordability. In the former category, the largest and best resourced organization in this category is NextGen America, a campus organizing group that evolved from the climate change group NextGen Climate Action Committee. NextGenâ€™s principal advantage is also their primary drawback, and it is their association with billionaire Tom Steyer who invests tens of millions of dollars in the organization. While this enables NextGen to organize on a much larger scale than Rise, it also means that Steyer is inseparable from their brand and public narrative of their work. 
 
 
 
 In headlines and earned media, NextGen is typically described as being driven by Steyer instead of the students organizing on the ground (e.g., â€œTom Steyerâ€™s group put in some serious voter registration work in 2018â€ is the first line of an October, 2018 Tampa Bay Times article). As a contrast, Riseâ€™s emphasis on studentsâ€™ leadership and our grassroots approach keeps students central in the public narrative (e.g., â€œTo get young people to vote, students ramp up the peer pressureâ€ is a San Francisco Chronicle headline about Riseâ€™s get out the vote work in October, 2018). Ultimately, Riseâ€™s approach underscores the idea that students are building their own power instead of working as an extension of a billionaireâ€™s campaign. Since NextGenâ€™s transition away from focusing exclusively on climate change organizing, they have not extensively engaged in issue advocacy. However, they could become a competitor for Riseâ€™s college affordability advocacy if that changes in the future. 
 
 
 
 Another similar competitor is the Alliance for Youth Action, a network of youth-led organizations across the nation that focus on voting rights, anti-poverty and youth power. While some of the Allianceâ€™s membership organizations address college affordability policies, it is not their principal focus or central to the Allianceâ€™s mission. 
 
 
 
 The second category of prospective competitor organizations includes research and policy groups working on college affordability such as the Campaign for College Opportunity, the College Promise Campaign, the Education Trust, The Institute for College Access and Success, and the Young Invincibles. Rise has built relationships with each organization through various initiatives and campaigns, but is differentiated from them in several key ways: First, these organizations do not build studentsâ€™ power or invest in studentsâ€™ leadership through advocacy or organizing opportunities. Additionally, while each of these organizations contributes meaningful work to policy conversations about college affordability, none is grounded in the notion that public higher education should be free (the College Promise Campaign is focused just on free community college). 
 
 
 
 Rise is founded on the notion that a crisis of the magnitude of college inaccessibility deserves an advocacy organization with a single issue area focus, and that students should lead the movement to address the issue that affects them most directly.","Riseâ€™s mission is to make higher education accessible to all - and the first step of this mission is to ensure that studentsâ€™ basic needs, food and shelter, are met. Solving for these basic needs will allow students from low and middle-income families to focus on their education as opposed to simply surviving. It will take some time to see increased college matriculation and graduation rates, but in the first two years of the project, we will define and measure success through:
 
 
 
 I) Identifying the current resources available to students in Los Angeles that address student homelessness and food insecurity
 
 
 
 II) Increasing student awareness of the resources available to them through on campus student training, organizing, events and activations. The number of student training and organizing meetings and events and activations at local community colleges/universities will be measured, as will the number of participants.
 
 
 
 III) Increasing enrollment in available programs (ex. CalFresh) and increasing utilization of available resources (ex. food pantries) through coordinated services integration. Enrollment and utilization numbers will be measured as will partnerships with service providers.
 
 
 
 In years one and two, we will collect baseline data to help us measure these outcomes. In years three through five, we will engage an external researcher to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the activities and outcomes of the campaign and assess the effectiveness of the project.","Organizing:

Rise solicits grants typically in the $10,000 to $50,000 range from individual and philanthropic funders who support our work.

CEO Donna Dubinsky and Lowercase Capital founder Chris Sacca in addition to philanthropies such as the Joyce Foundation and the Panta Rhea Foundation.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","Even with significant financial aid, many college students in Los Angeles are without stable shelter (20% of community college students) or food insecure. The inability to cover basic needs has decreased graduation rates, overwhelmingly affecting students from low and middle income families. Rise will raise awareness and utilization of the housing and food programs available to students and drive additional resources to address these issues, ultimately increasing higher education accessibility.","['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Lateral application (testing feasibility of a proven action/solution to a new issue or sector),"In 2018, Riseâ€™s students led an unprecedented campaign to stop tuition hikes at the CSU (3.8% prospective hike) and UC (2.5% prospective hike) that were previously approved by each systemâ€™s governing board and would have affected over 700,000 students.
 
 
 
 Between January and June of 2018, Rise led more than 15 lobbying trips for students to participate in legislative hearings and meet directly with state legislators to demand more state funding for public higher education. 
 
 
 
 One of those students was Sadia Khan. Sadia is the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, and comes from what she describes as a â€œvery low-income background."" Her father worked as a farm laborer to provide for the family, and more than anything wanted his children to receive an education. When her father died from a terminal illness during her 1st semester at San Bernardino Valley College, Sadia knew she had to keep her promise to her dad to get a higher education. Unfortunately, a year later, Sadia was raped and became pregnant, forcing her to take time off from school so that she could give birth to her son.
 
 
 
 Finally, in the spring of 2017, Sadia was accepted to Berkeley as a 3rd-year transfer student. A holdup with her FAFSA left Sadia, a single parent, homeless and struggling to afford food. For the first 2 weeks of the semester, she slept on the floor of her friendâ€™s 8-person, off-campus house and went to the food bank on campus for her meals. Overwhelmed by the stress of her financial insecurity, Sadia finally took out a $6,000 personal loan.
 
 
 
 Along with 15 to 20 other Berkeley students, Sadia rode a bus to the Sacramento Capitol building in March 2018 to attend a public hearing for the 2018-2019 education budget proposals. In her testimony, Sadia ran through her experiences since arriving on campus: struggling to afford food and housing and taking out loans just to cover the expenses her financial aid would have been allocated to had it not been delayed.
 
 
 
 By June of 2018, the tuition increases slated for the CSU and UC systems were taken off the table after Rise students like Sadia showed up together to personally share with legislators the increased burden it would place on them.

 To the detriment of California's students, college tuition has increased exponentially since the 1980s. However, surprisingly, the greatest expense for students across the stateâ€™s higher education system isnâ€™t tuition â€” itâ€™s housing and other living costs. According to a survey recently published by researchers at the Wisconsin HOPE Lab, more than a third of college students lack stable housing and don't always have enough to eat. 
 
 
 
 To make matters worse, there is a large disparity in the financial aid given out by community colleges versus universities - the lower the tuition cost, the lower the financial aid that is granted. Because community college students are less likely to seek and qualify for federal loans, and many community colleges donâ€™t offer them â€” students (and their families) are forced to come up with the remainder of the funds through work or other resources. This makes the effective cost of a community college education higher than for those who attend state colleges and universities.
 
 
 
 Given the many obstacles facing students from low and middle-income backgrounds (in addition to a full college course-load), oftentimes students are unaware of the resources available to them or discouraged by the applications processes (e.g. CalFresh, affordable housing).
 
 
 
 Riseâ€™s â€œHomework not Homelessnessâ€ / â€œHomework not Hungerâ€ campaign will address the student homelessness and food insecurity crises by 1) raising awareness of the resources available to students through on campus and community organizing efforts, 2) creating programs to facilitate easier application processes (ex. CalFresh) and greater utilization of resources via partnerships (ex. local food banks). The campaign will increase studentsâ€™ awareness and utilization of resources, positively impacting college matriculation and graduation rates due to the increased accessibility of higher education, especially for students from low and middle-income families.
 
 
 
 Our campaign leverages our unique expertise in building winning student-led advocacy campaigns with a relentless focus on inspiring supporters and building coalitions. 
 
 
 
 Targeting: Rise identifies â€œpressure pointsâ€ and mobilizes studentsâ€™ advocacy efforts accordingly.

Through our first partnership with MTV, we promoted the message that â€œCensorship is Un-Americanâ€ and empowered young people nationwide, particularly from marginalized communities, to make their voices heard. Since then, Rock the Vote has revolutionized the way we use pop culture, music, art, and technology to promote civic and community engagement and build collective power. Rock the Vote has registered and turned out millions of young voters, successfully fought for and defended voting rights, and lifted up the voices of young people to create change.
 
 
 
 A recent example of how Rock the Vote elevated and supported young voices to drive change was our work with the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. After the tragic mass shooting at their school in February of 2018, these students refused to be silenced or patronized. The Parkland students were connected to Rock the Vote, and we worked alongside them to ensure the movement provided the path for tangible civic action and engagement. 
 
 
 
 Rock the Vote supported the Parkland students throughout the process of their coordinating the national March for Our Lives. We powered voter registration efforts at the DC march and sibling marches around the country and their Road to Change bus tour through a customized online voter registration tool and text-to-code directing youth to register. We also advised the students on the voter registration process and how to capture contact data, engaged members of our network in promoting and volunteering at the march, produced voter registration drive and social media toolkits, helped to coordinate and set up volunteer training, hosted the official pre-march poster-making event, provided research and resources to inform the selection of Road to Change bus tour stops, and sent GOTV and other election reminders to youth registered through the Parkland Studentâ€™s movement.

 In partnership with LAUSD, Rock the Vote will pilot test the teaching the curriculum in LAs high schools. This will include getting the buy in of teachers and other stakeholders to build a culture where civics education is prioritized. We will also create a coalition of LA partners to promote the use of the curriculum by community centers and youth-serving organizations.

 Research has documented that almost 90% of 18-29 year-olds are on line and that engaging in activism through social media and other online tools led to offline activism. Rock the Vote will tap the enormous creative talent of the Los Angeles community by hosting three day-long or weekend-long â€œcreate-a-thonsâ€ for youth ages16-34 in the arts community. They will create original content such as memes, videos, flyers, posters, and graphics that will encourage voting, participating in the census, and volunteering to register voters and/or fighting misinformation about the census. Rock the Vote will recruit participants through local arts and civic engagement nonprofits, student organizations, Boys and Girls Clubs, and groups that engage people of color. We will also advertise the create-a-thons through creative media and entertainment partners, film schools, Facebook, and other social media channels.

2238752334,Move LA,We are coalition builders who instigated the Measure R and M campaigns that won $120 billion for transit and now seek to reduce the impact of transportation on air toxins and climate change.,"Our biggest challenge is finding common ground between competing agendas: business interests avoid increased taxes or fees while zero-emission vehicles require public investment; the goods movement industry wants truck-only lanes while impacted communities want an end to diesel.
 
 
 
 In developing Measures R and M we learned to formulate a ""grand bargain"" between often rival constituencies, many whom had never interacted with each other before, except in opposition. Our greatest strength came from convincing LA Biz Fed and the Coalition for Clean Air, the LA Bicycle Coalition and the LA Building Trades Council (and many others) that investment in public transit would benefit them all.
 
 
 
 The barriers we face on Vision 2020 may seem substantial from concerns over technical feasibility and cost to building trust in historically ignored communities. Yet, we know it can be done because we have done it before. We say to all, ""think big, but expect to win only 75% of what you want.""","Organizations that complement our work and are key coalition partners include Climate Resolve, CALSTART, Breathe LA, Environmental Defense Fund, LA Business Council, LA Biz Fed, Coalition for Clean Air, LA County Federation of Labor, LA-OC Building Trades Council, One LA, and others. However, their coalition efforts tend to focus on a few communities or like-minded groups rather than trying to create cross-sectoral understanding. No other organization builds regional alliances with labor, business, environmental, faith, senior and student interests to address regional solutions to pollution, emissions, and goods movement.
 
 
 
 Move LA does have complimentary partners at the state level that help further our work and are critical to our Visions 2020 effort. Move LA sits on the steering committee for ClimatePlan, a statewide network of dozens of organizations focused on meeting California's ambitious climate change goals. We have successfully advocated to include affordable housing, clean energy, and clean transportation for ""disadvantaged communities"" as part of cap-and-trade funding solutions.","We will define and measure outcomes by:
 
 - Success in the creation of a broad-based coalition that brings together business, labor, environmental and social justice advocates, faith, health, student, senior, persons with disabilities and underrepresented groups from disadvantaged communities to the policymaking table on air pollution and climate change strategies.
 
 - Recognition by appointed and elected leaders that we can clean our air and abate climate change while enhancing our economy by supporting the right public investments in clean technology and modernized infrastructure.
 
 - Identification of a preferred strategy to raise the $20 to $30 Billion needed over 20-30 years to address the transportation-related emissions challenges at the core of this effort. This could entail legislation in Sacramento and/or going to the ballot in 2020.
 
 - The number of people, either through their vote, in-person advocacy, or other means of engagement (such as online) who expressed their support for Vision 2020, the regional coalition or legislative/ballot initiative.
 
 
 
 Finally, we have an informal gauge for our success--our Executive Director's 22-year-old son inspired this project because he believes we are too late to turn back the tide on air pollution and climate change. If we can convince him that local change can have a global impact, then maybe he and we will all be able to breath easier.","Our budget for this project invests heavily in staff resources because broad-based coalition building requires a dedicated and concerted effort to meeting with, checking in, and coordinating across multiple partner organizations and interests. Below we explain, in broad detail, how we allocate our time and budget towards this project:
 
 
 
 - Build communities of shared knowledge and coalitions with multiple constituent groups, including historically excluded groups such as people with disabilities, with combined memberships exceeding 500,000 individuals. This work takes the most time and budget as it requires in-person meetings, consistent follow up, and providing updates, resources, and opportunities for activation including press conferences, community meetings, public hearings and digital activism (30% of budget and time
 
 including staff salaries, outreach associate subcontract, travel and media costs)
 
 
 
 - Develop creative policy and strategy proposals for local transportation programs and projects, regional, state and national policy. This work also takes significant time to research, write, update and communicate proposals with stakeholders, interest groups and government bodies (20% of budget and time including staff salaries, printing, travel, overhead and media costs)
 
 
 
 - Organize an annual conference and other events to bring together leaders from the growing coalition, activated supporters and policymakers. These events are prime opportunities to present and discuss, through a series of panels with political and organizational leaders, the latest update. These events engage thousands of people in both online and in-person conversations. (15% of staff time,
 
 catering/meeting and art & design budget)
 
 
 
 - Participating in other issue-oriented coalitions like ClimatePlan (statewide) and SLATE-Z (South LA) to activate and provide support through their networks of dozens of organizations with combined membership totaling in the tens of thousands (15% of staff time, travel local and long distance budget)
 
 
 
 - Informing and engaging via our website, blog, mass e-mail, social media, and opinion pieces to keep activated participants involved and engaged. Move LA maintains an active and engaged email list, website, and Twitter/Facebook pages with a total reach of 60,000+ individuals. (15% of staff time, digital media budget)
 
 
 
 - Speaking at other organizations' meetings/conference to build support and broaden the coalition (5% of staff time, travel budget)

 While the total expenses for this effort exceed that of the LA2050 Activation Challenge grant, Move LA is seeking and has received funds for this project through sponsorships and major individual gifts.","Move LA has already begun engaging local and national funding organizations and individuals to support this effort. These include other foundations along with individuals, socially responsible companies, and labor unions who are helping to fund this effort. We will continue to seek out forward-thinking individuals and foundations like LA2050 who want to activate people towards transformational local change.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","Move LA will build a broad coalition of diverse supporters towards a grand bargain to dump diesel, accelerate deployment of zero-emission cars and zero and near-zero emission trucks, and fund clean, regional transit infrastructure.

A demoralizing report on the radio caught his attention--funding for future transit projects was non-existent for the next 30 years.
 
 
 
 He had seen projections for Los Angeles County that anticipated several million new residents over the next few decades. For Denny, it was a crushing realization that we'd be stuck in that gridlock with more people coming and no money. As he recalled thinking at the time: ""Thatâ€™s a prescription for a world of hurt.â€
 
 
 
 Denny knew bold solutions were necessary to get through the political and very real gridlock ahead. So he called people he had worked with over the years in business, labor, and environmental communities and invited them to a meeting on transportation. Thirty-four out of the thirty-five invited showed up and the inspiration for Move LA was born. That initial meeting led to many more, followed by a conference attended by hundreds of people seeking a way out of gridlock. 
 
 
 
 Political leadership came together to introduce legislation and Denny Zane began work to build a grand coalition to support funding for transformational change in LA Countyâ€™s transportation system. This coalition, convened by Move LA, worked to convince LA Metro and LA Mayor Villaraigosa to give voters an opportunity to invest in a dramatic enhancement of the countyâ€™s transit systems. Measure R won approval with 67.4% voter support in November 2008. LA Metro under Mayor Garcettiâ€™s leadership returned to the ballot in November 2016 with Measure M, also extending Measure R. Voters said Yes by 71.1% and LA Metro will have $120 B over the next 40 years to fund what is by far the largest local public transportation investment program in the country. Wow!
 
 
 
 And while it may look like LA is on a roll, we know there is still work to do on clean air, traffic congestion, jobs, and greenhouse gas emissions if we are to fulfill our mission to make LA a place where people of all ages and incomes can live, work and thrive.","Our partner, Climate Resolve, is dedicated to telling the local climate story, winning policy measures, and providing solutions that will inspire Southern California to adapt and thrive in the face of climate change.

Move LA is convening multiple stakeholders to identifying public funding for accelerated deployment of zero-emission light and medium-duty vehicles, and zero and near-zero emission long-haul trucks; funding modernization, electrification and enhanced service on Metrolink, our regional commuter transit system; and funding local clean air transit and active transportation projects that allow alternatives to driving. This will result in the 18 million residents of Southern California being able to breath easier and live more sustainably.
 
 
 
 Transportation accounts for 90% of our NOx emissions, 80% from heavy-duty vehicles, most powered by diesel engines, resulting in the dirtiest air in the country. The heaviest exposure to diesel exhaust is experienced by low-income communities of color who live along the goods movement corridors of Southern California. It is a public health and an environmental justice imperative that we seek to replace diesel with clean technologies.
 
 
 
 In addition, transportation sources in Southern California account for 50% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions known to cause climate change. Rising seas and worsening droughts threaten our community and our world, today and for future generations.
 
 
 
 We now have a chance to save the world from climate change and clean our air because of decades of California leadership, leadership which has resulted in a growing array of zero-emission and advanced hybrid light-duty vehicles and the imminent deployment of zero and near-zero emission trucks. We are poised to play a powerful role in the worldwide efforts to abate climate change while helping free our region from exposure to air toxins; all we must do is find the strategies to accelerate the deployment of these clean vehicles significantly.
 
 
 
 Move LA's ""Vision 2020"" Proposal is that strategy and we are utilizing our innovative and successful civic engagement model for a massive public outreach and coalition building effort that will:
 
 - Enable the South Coast Air Quality Management District to deploy zero-emission vehicles on scale, helping to create the economies of scale needed for ZEVs to become ubiquitous;
 
 - Providing massive incentives for zero and near-zero emissions trucks to permanently dump diesel engines from our roads;
 
 - Create regional resources to electrify, expand, and provide enhanced and more affordable Metrolink service, making the system compatible with high-speed rail, while providing resources for each county to also develop transit feeder systems.

 Circle of Friends and Mother Road Studios will be building on decades of collective experience working with teachers, students with disabilities and those considered â€œat riskâ€ for dropping out, and the creative industries that LA is known for internationally. 
 
 
 
 Our strategy is to create an innovative program which culminates in an event where we can engage and expose parents, businesses and administrators to the power of collaboration and inclusion. In addition, Lâ€™Atelier will be promoted by the film it produces, giving it a life and exposure beyond the summer pilot.","Exceptional Minds is a program in LA that works primarily with students on the autism spectrum to develop skills to work and create in computer animation and digital arts industry. It is a great program, but it is cost-prohibitive and limited to higher functioning students.

It was founded by a mother and designer who partners with companies like Tommy Hilfiger to create adaptive and inclusive fashion, and they use models with disabilities in their fashion shows. It is compatible with Lâ€™Atelier in that we are inspiring and supporting future designers, models and consumers of all abilities.","Lâ€™Atelier LAâ€™s goals is to change attitudes, model behavior, and promote inclusion, positively impacting student development. We will measure progress in these goals through the following:
 
 â€¢ Pre and post assessment of skills like motivation, self-regulation, and emotional intelligence using instruments developed by CASEL, the Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning.
 
 â€¢ Weekly video diaries in which participants will share insights and progress
 
 â€¢ Completed project portfolios
 
 â€¢ Mock interviews for each project team with volunteers from the industry.
 
 â€¢ Audience discussions after the fashion show and subsequent viewings of the documentary to build new multidisciplinary collaboratives and explore future Lâ€™Atelier LA projects.","DETAILS  DESCRIPTION  BUDGET

Through weekly lunches and activities for students of with and without disabilities, CoF evolved into a student-led movement that builds awareness, acceptance and advocacy for people who behave or communicate differently. CoF Alumni kept in touch with their friends beyond high school, created inclusion clubs at college, and became successful educators, therapists and entrepreneurs. In 2009, CoF added a summer program, Circle Summer, to strengthen social skills and independence for high school students with disabilities who couldnâ€™t attend camp. They were paired with college-age peers in the Santa Monica area, near our original campus.
 
 
 
 Mother Road Studios (MRS), a B-Corp or public benefit corporation, is a fully-inclusive Production Studio that develops art to empower, educate and entertain.
 
 Co-founder, Christina Cannarella, has been an advocate for inclusion for over two decades. She fought to have her son with disabilities attend his home school in LAUSD, Taft HS. In 2004, teachers at Taft developed an inclusive, student-run fashion project. Christinaâ€™s son participated, and she created a docuseries of the program. Her experience with the fashion show and filming became the inspiration for MRS.
 
 
 
 We have found that education systems designed to support independent living and workforce development operate in isolation and segregate resources. This is a lost opportunity for students of all abilities to learn and achieve together, preparing them for a more inclusive workforce.
 
  
 
 The US Census Bureau reports that 1 in 5 Americans are living with a disability. Only 47% are employed, compared to 89% of the general population. The Valuable 500 recently launched to identify and promote companies working to address this inequity. 
 
 
 
 Circle of Friends and Mother Road Studios were inspired to link Circle Summer with their inclusive project-based film and fashion program to create a model that will engage students, and break down barriers while building crucial life skills and preparing them for future careers.","Mother Road Studios (MRS) is a B-Corp established by Christina Cannarella and Steven J. Tingus. Christinaâ€™s understanding of the importance of inclusion began when her younger son, Johnny, was born with a rare genetic make-up. As a parent, she experienced firsthand that society focuses on all that is â€œwrongâ€ with people with disabilities. In 2001, she read about CHIME Charter School, a program in Los Angeles, for children of all abilities, ethnicities and socioeconomic backgrounds. Christina and her sons headed west on the Mother Road (Route 66).
 
 
 
 When Johnny graduated from CHIME he had two choices for high school- a segregated setting for students with disabilities or his home school, Taft, where would be the only student out of 2700 with a â€œmoderate to severeâ€ disability. 
 
 
 
 Christina choose Taft. Many questioned her choice, but Eileen Caphina-Viadero, (aka â€œMs. Vâ€) the fashion teacher did not. Johnny was accepted and embraced in her class, and it had a profound impact as people's perceptions of him shifted. Christina learned that creativity and collaboration were key Ms. Vâ€™s 15-year old Lâ€™Atelier program and its annual, student-run fashion show. She started filming behind the scenes, capturing students with and without disabilities as they learned empathy, patience, understanding, acceptance, and gratitude in addition to job skills. Christina realized this was a program that could be extended to other schools and communities. Mother Road Studios is her realization of this vision.

Under the guidance of an award-winning Career Technical Education teacher with 15 yearsâ€™ fashion industry experience, participants will collaborate on fashion, from design and creation to accessories. In addition, MRS will teach a group of students how to document (via film, edit and production) the challenges and personal struggles the fashion and event teams face and overcome as they learn and create together. Tasks and responsibilities will be tailored to ensure that all participants truly contribute, and all projects are organized and led by students!
 
 Our program begins with a pencil art project, â€œWhatâ€™s Your Gift?â€ to help students focus on their strengths as they get to know each other. Theyâ€™ll learn the history of fashion and how it is influenced by culture, power and function. Fieldtrips to the FIDM Museum, local thrift stores, and visits from industry mentors and former students will provide inspiration as students create personal design portfolios. Teams will be given two challenges that require teamwork, communication and problem-solving: using repurposed materials and designing a line of adaptive clothing for people with disabilities. Projects will culminate with a fashion show and the powerful revelations and stories of personal growth and group achievement documented by the MRS team. 
 
 Through this project, students will gain acceptance and appreciation for othersâ€™ challenges and talents, while also developing 21st century skills like critical-thinking, collaboration, digital technology, and creativity that will prepare them for future careers in the fashion and film industries.

2343476170,Los Angeles Blockchain Lab,"A collaboration of academia, government and businesses, our mission is to grow LA into a sustainable blockchain innovation hub with a thriving ecosystem by creating jobs and fostering economic growth.","The LABâ€™s accomplishments and contributions have been made by a team of 15 volunteers who believe in blockchainâ€™s ability to transform the world for good and in LAâ€™s ability to lead the world in this transformation. No one is being paid and, other than a $15,000 sponsorship from Panasonic, all events have primarily been self-funded by the volunteers or through sponsors.
 
 
 
 Our biggest barrier is funding. With sufficient funds we could accomplish much more than we have already accomplished in the past year. To overcome this barrier to growth, we have filed for non-profit status and are seeking endorsement from LA City - similar to government endorsements at blockchain centers in other cities such as New York, Chicago, etc. Whereas community events may be free to attend, there may be a charge to take a class to cover costs. However, the largest funding support will come through a membership model. The LABâ€™s services will be made available for a membership fee ranging in price from $2500 to $250,000. Our membership pipeline includes corporations, VC firms, startups, international governments, blockchain service providers (such as consultants), etc. Members will be given access to networking, research, education, matchmaking, ecosystem map, etc. This model is based off of blockchain resource centers elsewhere in the US.
 
 
 
 Under the non-profit umbrella we are also launching a for-profit consulting service to help fund the non-profit. Its offerings include matchmaking services, feasibility studies (we will outsource to universities when possible), advertising options, product testing, etc. For example, we contracted professors and students from the various universities with expertise in supply chain to complete a feasibility study for a luxury automobile; giving students real-life experience while providing the company with unbiased resources. We are also researching the possibility of launching an incubator.","Yes there are several blockchain centers in the US. Some centers are backed by the local municipality such as New York and Chicago while others are independent including Silicon Valley, Detroit, Austin, etc. 
 
 
 
 However, we are extremely unique because of our volunteer team, transparency, and ability to collaborate. We like to consider ourselves the living blockchain! The only partnership of its kind, we are a collaboration with the local universities, groundbreaking startups, deep-pocketed investors, forward thinking government officials, and innovative enterprises. Founding partners include USC Viterbi Center for Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things; UCLA Andersonâ€™s Impact@Anderson initiative; Institute for Money, Technology, and Financial Inclusion at UCI, Blockchain at UCI and Panasonic Ventures.
 
 
 
 Because of our unique ability to collaborate, we have been invited to speak around the world, including the United Nations General Assembly â€œAll Things Blockchain,â€ the World Economic Forum Davos â€œAll Things Blockchain,â€ Richard Bransonâ€™s Blockchain Summit, Asia Financial Forum in Hong Kong, Monetary Authority of Singapore, and soon to present at Tripartite in New Zealand. We believe our ability to collaborate is a direct reflection of our community in LA where total strangers often come together on a shared vision to help the world.","Our ultimate definition of success is to see LA become a blockchain innovation hub and to not only prevent jobs from leaving LA but to actually create jobs and support growth. 
 
 
 
 To help us determine our success in reaching our goal, we are developing an ecosystem map to monitor the number of students earning blockchain degrees, graduates of our coding and jobs skills classes, recruitment and jobs placements, startups, businesses launching blockchain initiatives, blockchain service providers, and blockchain investors. A prototype will be available early this summer. Data collected will help us identify jobs created, startups initiated, and overall economic impact within Southern California.

She fled to the US but with the support of the media, Roya has returned to Afghanistan and back to teaching. She finds jobs for her graduates and pays them in bitcoin so that the young womenâ€™s fathers, husbands and brothers canâ€™t steal their money.
 
 
 
 After wiping away tears, Heidi promised Roya she would provide blockchain training through one of the universities in LA for Royaâ€™s young women, helping to solve two problems (1) worldâ€™s shortage of blockchain coders; and (2) financial independence for women. As such, and with our partner USC Viterbi School of Engineering, we are excited to launch a blockchain training program for these young women.

But OP is a much needed resource on many levels, and the team behind it consists of some of the best and brightest that LA has to offer. With decades of collective experience and far reaching networks in both public and private project development, we hope that any problem we might face during this process we will be able to solve with our collective effort.","Urban green-scaping is not a new concept, and many local Los Angeles firms are doing incredible jobs at building more enjoyable and sustainable urban environments through the use of landscape. What we are doing differently is combating many of the issues that plague urban life simultaneously, by targeting key principles we can easily address, which conveniently happen to involve climate-saving technologies that also strengthen each individual effect in doing so. 
 
 
 
 The main principles we are addressing with this scheme are:
 
 1) providing people with precisely tuned natural environments, using a proprietary five-sense ergonomic design process we call High Performance Design, that directly benefits both health and performance while alleviating environmental stresses caused by traditional urban conditions.
 
 
 
 2) creating better working conditions based on contemporary data, like the 2017 Gallup study titled â€˜State of the American Workplaceâ€™, that, put simply, finds that people need more choices, and more natural working environments in order to be the most productive and do their best work. OP addresses this through providing highly-designed areas for a variety of working requirements, all precisely tuned based on current data for optimum environmental conditions for creative and practical performance, giving local residents a valuable resource to their career goals.
 
 
 
 3) re-integrating wildness and nature back into our built environments and our consciousness. The data shows that we have alienated ourselves from the perception of dependency on our natural environments and because of this, we disassociate our actions to the greater planetary effect. We care about what helps us, and by rejoining these conditions and creating tuned experiences to showcase the benefits of these environments, we can regrow our awareness around our impact and work towards an educated population that both cares about their planet and knows how to care for it through better daily practices.
 
 
 
 These principles combined are what makes OP so powerful and unique, and what creates its immense value to any community.","Success for the project will be measured by both successfully completing the build, and by the impact it creates on the local community and the green community at large.

 OP will be designed and built using the most cutting-edge technologies and methodologies available for the highest benefit to human and environmental health. Los Angeles is a booming hub for clean-tech innovation and by leveraging the large community of inventors and experts in the area, OP will showcase the best LA and the world has to offer.
 
 
 
 A_S has over 10 years of experience in the designing and manufacturing of high-end, custom architectural spaces, and will be utilizing this experience and in-house manufacturing capabilities to ensure the highest quality product is achieved. But we are not alone.
 
 
 
 The Collaborator Team behind this project spans from local organizations and community development groups, to environmental technology businesses and pioneering carbon-negative manufacturing houses.
 
 
 
 TIMELINE
 
 If OP is funded through LA2050, the project will begin by defining a land-use agreement. This will be in collaboration with our community partners, Linear City and the ADLT Neighborhood Council, to find the best fit for the project and will prioritize the best experience for local pedestrian traffic as well centrality, to provide easy access for as many people as possible. (2-6 weeks)
 
 
 
 Once the land-use agreement is determined, we will begin designing the park per the location, based on our High Performance Design strategy which OP is based on, and with intimate communication between our various technology and manufacturing consultants to ensure this is a project that best showcases the full capacity of each group functioning as one team. (8-12 weeks)
 
 
 
 With the location, designs, and manufacturing approach determined, permitting, manufacturing, and construction will begin. This process will take us through to the end of the timeline, with an estimated duration of 5-7 months.
 
 
 
 LA2050
 
 OP is a project for everyone. As a pillar of LA2050â€™s goal for a better city for everyone and everything, it will provide an open, multi-use space to learn, create, play, connect and live for anyone who visits, all while fostering the highest performance and health for both us and our environment.
 
 
 
 CONNECT
 
 Although it was hard to choose just one, we chose to categorize this project under CONNECT because of the great potential that â€˜spaceâ€™ has to connect. OP will serve to connect us to each other, and back to our environment, by providing services like free Wifi, a variety of seating, meeting, and working places, incredible natural surroundings, and informational displays highlighting contemporary ideas behind how environments effect our health, happiness and performance. OP will also be a place for community events, connecting us for better civic engagement, and for sharing ideas. Or it can serve to simply connect us back to ourselves, with a beautiful atmosphere for easy access to a place for self-reflection or mental â€˜time awayâ€™.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,

2474400035,United Parents and Students,United Parents and Students provides training in the formal skills of community organizing and promotes authentic civic engagement and informed activism in historically underrepresented communities.,"The success of UPAS is built on a strategy of bringing together existing community groups in pursuit of a common cause rather than recruiting individuals or competing with existing, well-established groups. As such, UPAS is proudly multi-ethnic, multi-generational, and multi-regional, able to bring together a larger and broader range of members than found in single-issue organizations or those targeting a specific social or cultural demographic. This broad-based approach to organizing has achieved material and quantifiable success at both the neighborhood and city level. In Los Angeles, for example, African American and Latino families (Mexican Americans and families from a variety of Central American and South American countries) are coming together around shared visions for the future of their communities. UPAS serves as the connecting fabric for those that otherwise would likely not have an opportunity to collaborate. In addition to shared concerns, we also understand that communities have unique needs. 
 
 
 
 Last year, UPAS joined with Green Dot Public Schools California, KIPP LA, and Magnolia Charter Schools, to support immigrants against harassment and unjust deportation. In attendance were a state senator, the Los Angeles City Attorney, and high-ranking law enforcement officials, who assured the 200 people in attendance that law enforcement would not disclose immigration status to federal officials in the absence of a major criminal record. Additionally, in Los Angeles, UPAS families are focused on food justice for their entire community. For many families, particularly in African-American communities, this issue touches on deep civil rights concerns, raising memories of redlining and other practices that have encouraged disinvestment in communities of color.
 
 
 
 
 
 However, this strategyâ€”facilitating dialogue and collaboration between existing organizationsâ€”means that only those individuals served by a partner organization are invited to the table. Those community members not represented by an existing group, often the most marginalized and isolated, risk being left out of the conversation. Itâ€™s important for UPAS to take the time to fully understand and navigate the local political landscape and not inadvertently support the dominance of existing power structures that may not benefit all community members.
 
 
 
 Learning is an ongoing endeavor and organizing is a continuous cycle: trained organizing staff must not only continually reinforce and strengthen the knowledge base and skills of existing participants but also constantly broaden the scale of work to include more and more people through a vigorous schedule of 1-on-1s and house meetings. This work requires a reliable revenue stream that can support the development and retention of trained organizers and UPAS does not have access to public revenue nor, given the socio-economic profile of its participants, can fees be collected directly from participants. As a result, UPAS is reliant on the dues paid by partner organizations and supplemental funds from private philanthropy.","The diversity that enriches a community can also prevent the development of real power when the interests of specific groups are prioritized ahead of the welfare of the entire community. Typically, community-based organizations (CBOs) are either local -- serving only a neighborhood or section of a city -- or they are focused on a single issue. Others serve only one demographic in the community, for example providing services for youth or immigrants. Many CBOs provide robust and much needed social services, but devote only a small part of their mission and activities to community organizing. It is rare that a CBO focuses on widespread change for all community members.
 
 
 
 UPAS does not act alone in its mission to organize the residents of low-income communities to advocate for critical community needs. Important partners in this work include Inner City Struggle, Community Coalition, and Speak Up. UPAS respects the work of these organizations and has partnered with them in the past on specific initiatives. However, these organizations focus on individual membership and restrict their advocacy work to particular geographic areas in Los Angeles. UPAS membership is institutional, and UPAS is the only organization of its kind to build cultures of organizing across Los Angeles County. Though UPAS currently focuses its work in Inglewood, Watts, Willowbrook, West Athens, Venice, Fox Hills, and Compton, partnerships with other organizations broaden this geographic scope towards the goal of city-wide activation.","UPAS utilizes an innovative software database called M-Insights to measure quantitative impact. M-Insights tracks the attendance levels at each Parent Academy workshop, Leadership Institute, and public action. This data helps staff assess the evolution of program participation at the cohort and individual levels. M-Insights is also useful in measuring the impact of the voter mobilization initiative, allowing staff to document their interactions with prospective voters and track the particular outreach strategies that are most successful in leading people to register.
 
 
 
 UPASâ€™ success is ultimately dependent on the number of community members engaged and trained, the quality of training, and the frequency of civic engagement as a result. The overall reach and effectiveness of UPASâ€™ work is measured against ambitious goals which are designed by the Executive Director and Board through close collaboration with local families and site-based leaders who drive the work at the neighborhood level.
 
 
 
 -- By 2020, UPAS will engage 2,600 members to participate in Leadership Institutes per year.
 
 -- By 2020, 60 students will be trained through the Young Organizers Institute.
 
 -- 1500 parents will attend the UPAS 2020 assembly.
 
 -- By 2020, UPAS intends for two or more partner organizations to have submitted proposals for affiliate membership. Organizations that have expressed interest include KIPP Los Angeles, Magnolia Public Schools, and Camino Nuevo Charter Academy. 
 
 -- By 2020, a cumulative total of 6,557 parents and students will be registered to vote and at least 40 local public actions will be led by members each year.","Three (3) Community Engagement Associates to lead classes at the Leadership Institute and work with participants to prioritise community issues and develop strategic plans of action throughout the one year grant period.

 $4,000 is requested to cover overhead expenses, including rent, printing, and event materials.","UPAS is an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that does not receive any public revenue. UPASâ€™ operating budget for the 2018-19 year is $1,533,453, the majority of which is raised through service fees paid by partner organizations. Additional philanthropic support has been provided by Emma Bloombergâ€™s Murmuration, the Weingart Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Great Public Schools Now, the Joseph Drown Foundation, United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and the Wells Fargo Foundation. UPAS is in the process of developing a long-term financial model and sustainability plan that combines partner service fees, institutional member dues, philanthropy, and the pursuit of applicable government grants. The LA2050 challenge would expand the scope of UPASâ€™s focus and all funds from the challenge would be used to realize these goals.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","United Parents and Students envisions Los Angeles as a city where political power accurately reflects the populationâ€™s diversity. UPAS will continue to train and empower low-income community members to voice their concerns, engage city officials, and mobilize thousands of students and families to vote. It will also launch a broader activation strategy to raise awareness among Angelenos of the scale and impact of poverty, homelessness, underemployment, violence, and lack of access to healthcare.","['Central LA', 'East LA', 'South LA', 'Westside', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"â€œFor far too long having fast food restaurants on every corner has taken a toll on the health of our communities,â€ said Keisha Mitchell, a United Parents & Students leader. In many underserved neighborhoods there is a higher likelihood of residents finding multiple fast food chains than wholesome grocery stores, which requires residents to venture into other neighborhoods or settle for less healthy food options. Thatâ€™s why United Parents & Students launched a food justice campaign. Members have reported a prevalence of rotting, expired food and poor customer service in many of their local grocery stores. â€œHaving fresh food options within communities can have a huge impact on the overall quality of life,â€ said Mitchell. â€œNutritious food can change how disease and poor health plague areas that are saturated with unhealthy food options.â€
 
 Even though the Department of Public Health currently grades grocery stores, the department does not account for rotting produce, meat, and dairy products. â€œI have to travel outside of my community to have a good experience and thatâ€™s not okay,â€ recalled Isela Castro, another UPAS member. â€œI want to be able to shop in my community.â€
 
 As a result of their brewing frustration, families worked with UPAS to develop a report card and an evaluation process to hold grocery stores accountable for their food quality. Stores that meet these standards earn a United Parents & Students Certified Store of Excellence Seal to alert community members to its quality. While this seal may not be verified by local or state authorities yet, itâ€™s a critical step toward taking back the power to demand change, and reward progress, in their local stores.
 
 Grocery Outlet Inglewood was the first store to receive the seal; families wanted to recognize its efforts in meeting the standards. Ultimately, UPAS hopes to work with the city and county to institutionalize a county-wide program with a similar rubric and seal. â€œThe food justice campaign is important to me because I believe that all families should have equal access to affordable high quality food,â€ said Castro. â€œWe should be able to walk into the grocery stores in our communities and see fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy items, and affordable prices.â€",n/a,james.deavoll@greendot.org,James Deavoll,626-720-2914,"['Attendance at public/open streets gatherings', 'Government responsiveness to residentsâ€™ needs', 'Voting rates']","['LA is the best place to LEARN', 'LA is the best place to CREATE', 'LA is the healthiest place to LIVE']",[],[],Non-profit organization,"['Yes, in 2018']",NA,NA,NA,NA,www.facebook.com/UnitedParentsandStudents/,@unitedparentsandstudents,@,https://www.unitedparentsandstudents.org,https://vimeo.com/313460263,"['LA2050 website', 'Through another organization', 'Friend/colleague']",6-20 employees,No,,[],[],[],[],Los Angeles,"1149 S Hill St, Suite 600",81-3413763,United Parents and Students,California,90015,[],[],,www.unitedparentsandstudents.org/give/,www.unitedparentsandstudents.org/action-and-advocacy,United Parents and Students: Developing Cultures of Civic Engagement Across Los Angeles,LA is the best place to CONNECT,$1 million +,"Los Angeles has the the most rapidly rising rents in America, the highest rates of homelessness, and the fourth highest rate of income inequality among the countryâ€™s largest metropolitan areas. These issues hit low-income communities of color the hardest. But while 84% of the countyâ€™s eligible voters are registered, turnout in the cityâ€™s municipal elections is notoriously low, resulting in measures getting passed with fewer than 200,000 votes in a city with a population of almost four million.
 
 
 
 Many existing solutions to persistent community issues, while admirable, often treat community empowerment as a volunteer, grassroots pastime. UPAS fundamentally believes that in order to secure long-lasting community progress and revitalization, community organizing must be recognized as a profession requiring knowledge and strategic skills. Furthermore, UPASâ€™ training is based on an understanding that systemic change needs to be pursued and sustained by the community itself rather than through the efforts, however well intentioned, of others. The organization aims to help build the capacity of grassroots coalitions in which local families can participate and ultimately attain leadership roles. UPASâ€™ Theory of Change is built upon the development and nurturing of parent and student leaders as they work to activate the latent capital of their communities. The organization carries out its program through a structured program consisting of parent education, formal advocacy training, coordinated public actions, and voter registration initiatives.
 
 
 
 Education: UPASâ€™ Parent Academy offers free adult education workshops designed to develop basic skills and provide parents with a core understanding of the issues that most affect their communities. A schedule of classes, delivered at a partnering school site, is tailored to meet the needs of a particular neighborhood.
 
 
 
 Training: Building upon the foundational knowledge base provided by the Parent Academy, the Leadership Institute follows a training model utilized by the Industrial Areas Foundation since the 1970s to teach participants how to prioritize issues, draft solutions, and develop strategies to engage elected representatives in meaningful and informed dialogue.
 
 
 
 Public Action: Operating under the core belief that meaningful change is the direct result of concerted public action, UPAS translates theory into practice by guiding members to apply their education and training to active civic participation. UPASâ€™ public initiatives have resulted in many successful community-wide accomplishments.
 
 
 
 Voter Mobilization: UPAS believes that action demonstrated through voting is essential to the organizationâ€™s strategy; meaningful self-advocacy requires communities to combine public action and voter registration efforts in order to establish and sustain broader, coalition-based civic engagement.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,
2608898038,Inspiring Service,Our mission is to inspire and empower people and organizations to engage in volunteering that improves and strengthens communities and themselves. We strengthen volunteer ecosystems with technology.,"Todayâ€™s Internet makes it possible for consumers to find or buy anything. But the absurdity is that when the majority of people who are moved to help (or to volunteer) try to find opportunities to help they canâ€™t find what they are looking for, so they give up.
 
 
 
 As a result, volunteerism has declined nationally because the old ways of connecting and the many organizations in our communities that operate them donâ€™t work or are grossly inefficient. 
 
 
 
 Our technology and operating philosophy, which is helping many people of all ages more easily find and connect with their ways to help in Ohio and Nevada, will be able to empower many more as we grow and expand across the country.
 
 
 
 But unlike most things that the Internet is disrupting, there is no big money to be made by disrupting the way volunteers connect. Volunteers arenâ€™t going to pay for a new or better service. Afterall, they are trying to do something good for mankind, and shouldnâ€™t have to pay for it. Nonprofits canâ€™t afford to pay for a better pipeline. Or the ones who can afford it create the very scenario weâ€™re trying to avoid where only a few nonprofits advertise volunteer needs around a narrow band of interest or for a specific time. Under the existing platforms, many prospective volunteers get frustrated in not being able to find opportunities that match their desires, and so they give up trying.
 
 
 
 Our solution for overcoming this is the creation of an efficient and effective operating technology that once-and-for-all reverses the volunteerism rate declines being experienced all over the country, and in the Los Angeles region specifically. Status quo is rampant in the volunteer support ecosystem, but we believe that collaborative innovation can ultimately win out based on our proven model.
 
 
 
 The size and complexity of the Greater Los Angeles marketplace will be a challenge. As a result, we openly will look to leverage the LA2050 community to support and participate in this project. Our success in Ohio has been a result of grassroots and specialized marketing, and we will look to LA2050 to leverage social media, newsletters, thought leadership, blogs, creative designs and other technical assistance.","Yes and no, since the World Wide Web became mainstream in the 1990s, people have been trying to connect volunteers with opportunities to volunteer. Several platforms exist in the Los Angeles region, but all fall short of our differentiators -- a user experience design, a progressive web app approach and our identification as a technology nonprofit. These existing systems were all built on the model that mimics match.com. For a variety of reasons that model has limited effectiveness. No one other than us has taken a far more modern approach leveraging models such as Airbnb, Yelp, Uber and Lyft. 
 
 
 
 Our technology is built with an eye to the future. Our architecture is managed in a scalable Google Cloud Platform environment and designed as a progressive web app utilizing the benefits of a MERN stack and other state-of-the-art technologies. We believe this uniquely positions us to supply the next generation of volunteer-focused technology for communities, businesses and nonprofits. 
 
 
 
 Nothing like it exists anywhere. First and foremost, it's built with the user in mind, making it friction-less for the user to gain access and interact with opportunities and the places that offer opportunities. All previous platforms that exist today require registrations and passwords. Again, with the user in mind, the site is designed to enhance the experience and appeal to the widest range of users, whether tech savvy or not -- with deep use of photos, maps and other graphics. Each nonprofit using the site is treated the same and is presented at a high level of quality . This levels the playing field in a competitive market for volunteers where the largest and most marketing-savvy nonprofits usually win out. We're seeing a substantial increase in volunteers interested in helping smaller organizations. 
 
 The core product has served the general volunteer market -- helping users find their places to help and sort through the myriad of ways to help. Its dynamic content includes daily and weekly events open to a broad audience and where significant numbers of volunteers are needed. Enhancements to the platform connect ""high value volunteers"" -- board service and skills-based to nonprofits seeking them. While technology cannot be successful on its own, our friction-less, mobile-optimized approach is revolutionizing the volunteerism ecosystem. 
 
 
 
 The volunteer landscape has changed significantly over the last couple of generations, during which our ways of engaging, communicating, and connecting transformed completely with the rise of technology. Whereas older generations knew their local institutions â€“ such as the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, the Salvation Army, among others â€“ and committed their time to an organization from the start, younger generations are surrounded by information and opportunities. They have the privilege of exploring options and being discerning in how they choose to spend their time. They expect to be able to do things quickly and access information easily, with fast-moving, visually appealing digital tools. Older generations approached volunteering as a commitment. Younger generations see it as an opportunity to give back, while also building social networks and gaining life experience. They start curious, and if they enjoy an experience they progress to casual. They will commit deeply to something they fully support but it will take them time to do so. But once they are committed, they are catalysts for an organization; they bring with them their passion, their networks of friends, and their social media channels. A new platform like ours will help future generations reverse the declines in national volunteer rates, and help re-establish volunteerism as a core human responsibility for generations to come.
 
 
 
 In todayâ€™s VUCA -- volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous -- world, thereâ€™s always a new trend on the horizon. While not all trends lend themselves to our work, we make an active effort to understand what aspects of leading technology platforms and startups lend themselves to better connect a volunteer with a way to help. Our technology-first and trends-driven approach allows us to provide an unrivaled experience for people looking to volunteer.
 
 
 
 Our community-wide volunteer guide is derived from a combination of Airbnb, Yelp, Uber and Lyft. Our design is heavily influenced from Airbnbâ€™s exquisite, award-winning user experience. Our commitment to being comprehensive rivals that of Yelp. Our model works similar to Uber and Lyftâ€™s â€œlast mile.â€ Weâ€™re disrupting an industry that has operated at status quo for at least two decades. Our approach allows potential volunteers to see everything and simply reach out when they find what they are looking for. There is really no need to create an account or jump through hoops when youâ€™re just trying to help out your fellow man, woman, child or animal.","Our measures are your measures, and our connections to the region make this a personal passion that clearly defines our view that failure of this launch is not an option. As mentioned elsewhere, Craig Young was born in Los Angeles and his family connections (aunts, uncles and cousins) make this work a homecoming for him and his family. His mother and father met at and graduated from Hollywood High. His grandparents lived and died in Los Angeles. As a result of these long family ties as well as Craigâ€™s business interests elsewhere in California during his earlier years in business, Craig maintains a broad network of family, friends and colleagues working and living in the Southern California region. Also as mentioned, Craigâ€™s son, Michael, graduated from the University of Southern California, as did his older son and father. The combination of family and business ties to this region makes this a more personal desire to help the region than any of the other communities we serve.
 
 
 
 The LA2050 goal calls for Los Angeles to lead the nation in voting and volunteerism rates. Research demonstrates strong ties between increased volunteerism and increased voter rates, so we see ourselves helping with voting rates as well as our core goal of helping to get 60 percent of Greater Los Angeles residents volunteering vs. 24.1 percent now. Our most defining metric is when a potential volunteer contacts an organization, a unit of a measure we call a referral. We actively monitor referrals to identify trends, monitor site usage and evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We can even tell when the organizations who receive our referrals arenâ€™t responding, another factor in volunteer fatigue we hope to alleviate. Significant growth in referrals along with implementing change management in the way nonprofits engage volunteers will be the key drivers behind defining success as we move forward.","Our budget for the launch of this project calls for approximately $20,000 in standard operating expenses and $150,000 in staff time and personnel expense, spread across a primary project manager, Michael Young, one of our co-founders, and the dedication of a lead researcher/data coordinator. We anticipate one or both being located in Los Angeles for at least the first year. They both would be supported by our full technology team and others in our Ohio organization providing support across all our active projects. The $100,000 grant would be supplemented by $70,000 coming from other philanthropic sources or a combination of 3-5 business clients receiving benefits for the services we deliver to them around better community engagement.

Young and his wife, Mary Beth, whose kids then were 6-, 4- and 3-years-old, began to take an active interest in philanthropy, supporting organizations impacting quality of life, such as UNICEF, WWF, the American Red Cross, United Way and Salvation Army. As the kids grew older, themes began to emerge -- helping people who donâ€™t have opportunities in life, humanitarian causes and improving quality of life for all. Every year, the Youngs would provide their kids with poker chips and information about various causes and let the kids place their chips on the cause brochures they had gathered as a way of choosing where the familyâ€™s philanthropy would go. The family also embarked on hands-on philanthropy. As the kids grew older, they challenged their dad to merge his business, technology and volunteering interests. Young became a board member of a number of local and national organizations, exposing him to another significant volunteer activity. Along with partners, Young in 2007 created UGIVE.ORG, a nonprofit aimed at catalyzing, exciting and empowering the next generation of volunteers. The program expanded to high school and college campuses in 22 states when it was merged with the Muhammad Ali Center. In 2010, Young's son, Michael, a USC grad, created myActions, which with Young's and Michael's friends' help became the leading student-powered college network for sharing sustainable and socially responsible actions. Young became concerned about the systems supporting volunteers, leading in 2017 to the creation of 501(c)(3) Inspiring Service, which turned its attention to creating technology platforms that would better connect volunteers to ways to help in the community where they live.","Just as we have experienced in Ohio, Nevada and New England, we would expect to have a myriad of partners in the Greater Los Angeles region to launch this project this fall and get it to a one-year normalized operation by next summer. First and foremost, the nearly 2,000 core volunteer-engaging organizations in Los Angeles County will be our first critical partners. Organizations to whom these nonprofits belong or are accredited or supported by -- United Ways, community foundations, chambers of commerce, BBBs, neighborhood associations, university affiliations, etc. -- will be our first touch points as we begin our work in creating a comprehensive guide. The roles of these coordinating organizations are to help us with the communication of the concept and the benefits of being represented on the platform for each of their organizations. The next level of engagement will be with the 5,000+ nonprofit organizations who only use volunteers for their board or for highly-skilled needs. Our board matching and skills-based technology capabilities are designed to collaborate with organizations who already maintain a leading position in training leaders, and would include chambers, nonprofit support organizations focused on training and other kindred spirits. All forms of media become project supporters depending on the audience needing to be reached, and we have experience being able to tap these resources.
 
 
 
 Widespread geographic partnerships are critical to the success of this project. Due to the transportation challenges in the Greater Los Angeles region, the vast majority of people who want to volunteer want to do so close to their home, work or where they spend most of their free time. As a result, our emphasis on comprehension requires us to have full engagement by nonprofits across all cities, neighborhoods, campuses, business districts and any other organized geographic bodies within the Los Angeles County in order to provide the kind of impact our platform is designed to deliver.
 
 
 
 Just as we have a strong relationship with Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley and his staff, we would anticipate partnering with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, the Mayor's Office of Volunteer Engagement (MOVE) and its two advisory councils to build on the work of VolunteerLA. In late 2017, we built the giveoneforcincy.org platform that has become the Cincinnati mayor's primary platform for inspiring more service by residents of the region. In addition to building it, we have worked with the Cincinnati mayor's office as the primary promoter and execution partner. We far surpassed our year-one goal and are on track to achieve the mayor's goal for year two, a 150 percent increase over the first year's goal.
 
 
 
 In short, we view this project as a community asset, and would welcome any and all to help us ensure that the entire community is engaged in the platform for the benefit of the Greater Los Angeles region.",michael@inspiringservice.org,Michael Young,513-236-5676,"['Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support', 'Rates of volunteerism', 'Voting rates']","['LA is the best place to LEARN', 'LA is the best place to CREATE', 'LA is the best place to PLAY', 'LA is the healthiest place to LIVE']",[],[],Non-profit organization,['No'],n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,https://www.facebook.com/InspiringService/,@inspiringservice,@InspiringSvc,https://inspiringservice.org,https://vimeo.com/327368094,['Friend/colleague'],6-20 employees,No,,[],[],[],[],Cincinnati,"1776 Mentor Ave, Suite 200",82-1699198,Â Inspiring ServiceÂ,Ohio,45212,[],[],,https://www.paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/2828570,https://cincinnaticares.org/listing-item/cincinnati-cares/,LA Connect 2050,LA is the best place to CONNECT,"$500,000-$1 million","Our project is the creation of a digital community-wide volunteer guide (CVG), LA Connect 2050, tentatively located at LAConnect2050.org. This guide will be patterned after our successful CVGs in Ohio and Nevada, where our platforms have become the most popular places for citizens of those respective regions to find ways to help (volunteer). Based on our other successes, we project LA Connect 2050 would, after 24 months of operation, have helped tens of thousands of citizens of Los Angeles County find their way to help, many of whom would otherwise have given up due to the lack of a comprehensive guide in the region. As awareness and confidence in the platform builds based on marketing and staff support from LA2050, we would expect the citizen connections to grow substantially in the second full year, and continue to grow annually for the next 10 years and subsequent two decades. Based on this growth in helping Greater Los Angeles residents find their way to help, LAConnect2050.org will ensure the rise of the Los Angeles region's volunteer rates from the current 2.48 million (24.1 percent of the current 10 million+ population) to more than 8.78 million (65 percent of the projected 13.5 million population) by 2050. This achieves one of LA2050â€™s major measurable metrics. Volumes of research credit greater volunteerism with increased voting rates and better social and emotional status of participating citizens, for which LA Connect 2050 will also contribute to improving. Critical to the success of the platform will be its comprehension in all geographies, capturing all volunteer-engaging organizations in Los Angeles County. Most volunteer-engaging organizations in the region -- we estimate there are roughly 8,000-10,000 -- will welcome the opportunity to be part of the guide because it will be free. And our online forms make it easy for them to do so. But it will be important to invest resources to ensure that all organizations are represented, regardless of the organizationâ€™s ability to create a profile. Key to our success will be high-quality content. One of the first steps to achieve comprehension is to develop partnerships and cooperation from the dozens of nonprofit organizing coalitions -- community foundations, United Ways, chambers of commerce and other similar bodies who can provide quick access and verification that the vast majority of nonprofits they work with gets communication and direction on how to be part of the CVG. We estimate the timeline to get to 75 percent comprehension is about one year. With funding this summer, the site can go live this fall. Our platform supports all aspects of volunteerism, from hands-on work to skills-based to board level, across all causes -- creating a one-stop shop for the region. An ongoing communication schedule with all nonprofits organized by cause on a monthly basis ensures that the platform's information and the ways for which they are seeking help always remains up-to-date.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,

Real estate in California but specifically Los Angeles is always at a prime and looking for a location with significant space to facilitate the various activities that we have planned will come at a premium. To overcome this challenge we will be working with our team of volunteers within the organization as well as our partners such as the WOmenâ€™s Club and local Chamber of Commerce, to assist with securing the location as well as a long term lease with the building owner. Additionally since our organization is run by volunteer staff, we are able to allocate a significant portion of our funds to cover the cost of rent, upgrades and utilities.","There are a few organizations that support and facilitate programs for individuals with disabilities, specifically ASD however what sets us apart is that we are providing programs for individuals who have â€œaged outâ€ of the system. Additionally our organization works to bridge the gap between individuals with an ASD and their neurotypical peers and community members. We are focused on education, inclusion and community development. Finally we are working on partnerships with existing programs that cater to the younger individuals that way we can provide a transition / bridge as they begin to age out of the other community programs.","Success will be defined by the number of youth and young adults who ultimately participate in community programs, events and activities as a result of their personal development in the area of socialization. Our goal is for participants to be able to include themselves in typical community activities including future training and employment on a road to their appropriate level of self-sustainability. 
 
 
 
 Additionally success will be measured by the number of community agencies, businesses and organizations extending invitations to individuals with an ASD to partner, join and/or become employed by them.

 A community enterprise is essential:
 
 â€¢ It provides an additional reason for community residents to become involved with their community and simultaneously with people with disabilities
 
 â€¢ It serves as a vocational or social program for the residents, reducing the cost of adult day programs

 Information about the population being served
 
 One in 59 children have been diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder and many of the children as well as adults on the autism spectrum need help in learning how to act in different types of social situations. They often have the desire to interact with others, but may not know how to engage friends or may be overwhelmed by the idea of new experiences. Similarly, neurotypical peers and adults are often uncertain how to interact and often overwhelmed when presented in a situation involving an someone with an ASD. Xavierâ€™s Place will facilitate Community inclusion addressing the challenge where individuals with an ASD often do not participate in community activities in a meaningful way, in roles that allow them to demonstrate their abilities, establish true relationships with others, earn recognition and respect from others, learn new skills, or simply to have fun.

Especially in a school setting, this immediately puts our audience in a place of skepticism. It is in our core values that education is a human right and should be offered for free. Furthermore, civic and global engagement opportunities should not have limited access. Overcoming skepticism will be a challenge, but one that we will tackle through our storytelling, and our personal relationship approach to building a reputation among educators. Next, we anticipate having to overcome the barrier that many parents and members of the educational community will think this is a fundraising platform for charities. Students will never be solicited for money, nor will we ever collect student data. Both are valid concerns we anticipate but ones we are ready to work through.","There are several other tools in the space such as Udemy, Blackboard Learn, IEarn, and maybe even Khan Academy. The latter was actually a proof-of-concept example that we derived a great deal of inspiration from.

We look forward to raising support for our high school curriculum where will tackle issues surrounding registering to vote, being a citizen, and how to community organize around an issue that is central to them. The other platforms do not have such a boundaried focus.","We will define success based on three key indicators: 
 
 
 
 1) Our usefulness to educators. 
 
 This can be tracked through the analytics we are collecting to measure teachersâ€™ time on site, number of logins, number of completed videos, number of students they onboard, and the number of other teachers they refer. All of these metrics are being captured and reported through our custom Salesforce platform. With Deedlyâ€™s home base being in LA, it has a focus to first impact itâ€™s home city and target amplification in and around LA county. Deedly creates an open-source platform which gives access to our program to all educators. Not only is it designed by experts in curriculum, teaching, and pedagogy, and therefore aligned to California 8th grade Social Studies standards, it incorporates requirements that further Title IV initiative for a well-rounded student and education in college/career readiness. 
 
 
 
 2) The ability to activate students.
 
 Deedlyâ€™s focus is to primarily education, but then necessarily to activate. For our 8th grade content, we are focusing on LA -based non-profit partners who we can guide our audience to engage with after they have gone through our program. Conversion from platform-to-irl activism is of utmost importance to Deedlyâ€™s programming and success. Since Deedly is dedicated to empower all students with this content and message, the platform will be open-sourced and available to students at any resource level. 
 
  
 
 3) Support the â€˜Change Makersâ€™. 
 
 We aim to be a revenue generating stream for our carefully vetted charity partners. The amount of funds we can donate to enable their life-changing work will be a measure of our success, but ultimately the way we bring light to their issue, their time and the changes they are trying to make will build us the success we are really aiming for.

We showed them a video on the world water crisis where a 13yr old girl has to carry a 40 pound jerry can 3 miles every day -just to get water for her family- and in doing so giving up her opportunity for an education. After the video was over we asked the children to carry a similar jerry can across a basketball court to allow them to physically understand the journey of the young girl they had just learnt about. One of the students came up to our co-founder Serinda Swan and told her how just yesterday she was complaining to her mother about having to carry all the groceries in from the car. She said a lightbulb went off during our curriculum at how lucky she was that those bags contained food. That she could walk to the sink and get clean water and that she didnâ€™t have to give up her education for basic human needs. She said that she had always considered that she was the â€˜charityâ€™ but she said after watching our Deedly video she realized that a donation is not just monetary - itâ€™s using your voice, using a dollar as a vote, and using your spending power (no matter how big or small) to inform the decisions of corporations. She understood that with every action she can create change and that was something she was looking forward to doing in the future both within the Deedly curriculum and now outside in her every day life.

 Each day, students will view a video segment outlining a world issue, and the vetted non-profit that has made tangible, measurable efforts in positively affecting this issue. These videos are supported with a â€œchallengeâ€ in the form of a quiz, and lesson plans that support multiple learning modalities. Upon completion of the quiz, students are awarded â€œDeed Coins,â€ which they are able to donate directly to the charity they just learned about. The technology has built-in functionality for students to select an area they are most interested in donating their coins to - providing even greater value-add to charities in the form of analytics to help them understand what programs motivate this population to give. To date, Deedly has created and successfully piloted its 6th grade curriculum, and is in the process of completing its 7th. Our LA based production team was part of the minds behind KONY2012 -the largest online movement in history- and our Head of Education has a PhD in pedagogy, curriculum and her research expertise is on â€œefficacious empathy.â€ 
 
 Weâ€™ve invested in creating a robust Salesforce platform which implements user tracking that will give us insight on how the tool and curriculum is being used. Through this we can identify pain points quickly and create automation to rapidly expand our audience. 
 
 
 
 Population Being Served:
 
 It is explicit through Deedlyâ€™s business model that this platform is accessible to all student populations. We prioritize diversity and equity to be sure that our curriculum will be engaging, and we take care to run content and language through a number of different communities to ensure we embody inclusivity. Deedly believes that all students have a significant contribution to offer and should be given the opportunity here in Los Angeles and globally.

 8th grade content creation would begin July 15; be completed September 15; and launch October 1.
 
 
 
 Measurable progress: 
 
 We see Deedly as an invaluable opportunity. Our objective is to equip the students of LA with the knowledge of world issues, empower them to make informed world changing decisions while simultaneously offering them the ability to donate monetarily at no cost to them, their teacher or the charities they are supporting.

As a young boy, Hav A Sole founder, Rikki Mendias spent years in a shelter with his mother. During that challenging time they couldnâ€™t even afford to buy a pair of shoes. One day a former resident noticed he had holes in the bottom of his sneakers and took him to buy two new pairs. Rikki never forgot her kindness, but the feeling he got from having new kicks, spawned an insatiable need in him to collect shoes. 
 
 Fast forward, to 2014, Rikki had over one hundred and fifty pair of shoes, when he suddenly realized there were people out there who had none. Thatâ€™s when he loaded the back of his car and drove the streets until he found someone who could benefit from a newer pair of shoes. With their permission, Rikki took a before and after photo and posted it on social media. Inspired, many of his followers started sending in tennis shoes from all over the country, and thatâ€™s how Hav A Sole was born.
 
 Rikki sees homelessness as a big equity issue given that individuals experiencing homelessness are some of the most marginalized and disadvantaged people in our society. Focusing resources and investments on youth and homeless communities that have been left behind will produce the greatest returns. Accordingly we have developed this program to address one of the major inequities in the communities we serve.
 
 Hav A Sole Wheels has touched thousands of lives through, social activism, volunteering and building community. In four years we've given out over 13,000 pairs of shoes in 20 cities while touching thousands of lives.
 
 Our efforts included an emergency fundraiser held in Los Angeles for the Hurricane Harvey victims. This event took place over an entire weekend at Horace Mann Junior High bringing together individuals and grass root organizations from local communities which produced 1,500 pairs of shoes and carloads of supplies fitting a 53-foot semi-truck which transported these supplies to Houston by the Hav A Sole team. 
 
 Recently, Hav A Sole relocated its offices and storage space directly in the Downtown Los Angelesâ€™ Skid Row area where many of these programs take place.","In 2017 Hav A Sole held over 40 events in locations all over Los Angeles and surrounding communities impacting over 3,500 youth, adults and volunteers. Though this is not a collaborative proposal, Hav A Sole partners with charities and organizations in and around Los Angeles to bring our services to them. Some of the organizations we have partnered with, include My Friendâ€™s Place, CLARE Foundation, Covenant House, and Union Rescue Mission.

 Our movement affects individuals who receives the shoes while increasing a sense of responsibility for donors and volunteers offering them a way connect. Hav A Soleâ€™s goal for 2019 is to double our efforts so we can increase the amount of shoes given out, our programs and outreach includes:
 
 1. Hav A Sole Direct Outreach (local daily) â€“ Through our daily outreach we ensure anytime we see a need we can fill that need for reliable footwear. On a daily basis our team identify, fit, and donates shoes to those in need â€“yes, that means if we cross paths with a homeless person in need of shoes, we offer help on the spot!Â 
 
 2. Hav A Sole Partnerships Local Distribution Eventsâ€“ partnership with various footwear companies we organize donation events to encourage shoe lovers to donate their unwanted shoes. We then organize volunteer days to distribute the footwear. Each outreach day is a chance to foster partnerships, encourage community service, and make a real connection within the community.Â 
 
 3. #havAsolefultrip â€“ In collaboration with various NBA team owners, players, coaches and fans, we organize 2-3 nationwide outreaches per year to bring attention to the national crisis of homelessness. These successful outreach allow us to collect shoes and other donations, while viral connections are made both on and off-lineÂ 
 
 4. Disaster Relief â€“ In the past 2 years, Hav A Sole has had the opportunity and resources to organize and mobilize outreach teams during several heartbreaking natural disasters. With a surplus in shoes and a warehouse to keep them, we aim to be the number one distributor of footwear during natural disasters.Â 
 
 5. Hav A Sole Kids â€“ through our partnership with NBA to provide shoes and other resources to children participating in NBA children and youth programs we organize and distribute shoe donations to school aged children.Â

2725593509,Root Down LA,RootDown LA empowers youth to succeed through healthy ventures in their communities.,"In South Los Angeles (SLA) where RootDown LA (RDLA) works, there is a compelling combination of challenges and opportunities to meet the food needs of our primarily low-income residents. Where we work, health and economic disparities make it challenging for residents to thrive: 51-72% of all households (predominately Latin/African American) are at or below the 185% FPL[1]; The LA County Department of Public Health reports, 37% of adults and 30% of youth here are obese and 11% of all adults in SLA have been diagnosed with diabetes - nearly double the percentage of those diagnosed in other Los Angeles Service Planning Areas (SPAs) [2]; in 2009 diabetes emerged in our SPA as a leading cause for death, ranked fourth below coronary heart disease, stroke and lung cancer - all diet related illnesses.
 
 
 
  Fortunately, RDLA is tapped into one of SLAâ€™s most resilient resources to help address this demand - SLA youth! RDLA and project partners share a strong common vision: they believe that SLAâ€™s young people, given even moderate educational or vocational supports and opportunities, are thrilled to become actively engaged in the creation of long-term solutions to the challenge of food insecurity. 
 
 
 
 With careful planning and cooperation among groups like ours, groups that collectively offer expertise in for-profit food ventures, culturally relevant food and nutrition education, SLA produce production, youth-mentoring, and direct community engagement, we can successfully build on comprehensive responses to local food, farm, and nutrition issues in our community.","Yes, there are many organizations addressing the same issue as RootDown LA.
 
 
 
 What sets us apart? RootDown LAâ€™s co-founder and executive director has been developing state and federally funded healthy food programs for the most food-insecure urban populations in San Francisco and South Los Angeles since 2004. Through that trajectory weâ€™ve understood nutrition education can be complex and confusing, that is why RootDown LA keeps it simple and relevant for all audiences!
 
 
 
 We focus on veggies because these are usually the foods that those who are trying to make dietary changes to achieve low-glycemic diets, find hardest to incorporate into daily meals. RootDownâ€™s fun, live demos provide techniques to make the daily incorporation of fresh food into a diet easier and even desirable.
 
 
 
 While most nutrition educators talk about the healthy foods you should eat, RootDown LA explores the reasons why we are eating what we do and why we may not eat what they feel they should. More often than not, people simply think healthy foods are nasty, expensive, or too time consuming to prepare, and understandably so. It takes just a little bit of skill and knowledge to incorporate raw, straight from the earth veggies into delicious meals we want to eat. This can be simple and also affordable.","RDLAâ€™s greatest success can be observed in the passion and commitment from our youth, who are advocates for, and now run the majority of our programs; eleven are paid employees, who train and manage the next generations of younger youth interns. You can find them all online - their collective enthusiasm is reflected in our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, which they post in, regularly.
 
 
 
 We will rely on formative assessments, getting feedback in real time and redirecting when necessary. Summative assessments will use both quantitative and qualitative measurements - such as the increase in knowledge and confidence of trainees, increased access to healthy food, and the number of graduates who secure employment. We measure progress of the organization in terms of the depth of our partnerships in the community, and our relevance where we work, as is expressed by constant demand for us to increase our programming.","Line Item Budget LA 2050

Back then and still today, SLA residents experience disproportionately high rates of diet-related illnesses like diabetes, compared to other parts of SLA and this is due primarily to a lack of access to, and daily consumption of healthy, nutrient rich foods. These students saw the infrastructure surrounding this notorious low-income community and commonly described food desert - underfunded school lunch programs, copious liquor and fast food stores, poverty, and peoplesâ€™ hectic lives all still create complex barriers to healthy eating that people in other parts of LA donâ€™t face. They asked, â€œHow can we change the way our community eats?â€ RDLA formed to support these and other SLA youth to increase their own capacity to develop local solutions to address food insecurity in SLA.

Changing public opinion about the formerly incarcerated is not easy, and evidence shows that having a criminal record reduces employer callback rates by 50%. When formerly incarcerated people do land jobs, they earn 40% less on average than peers without a criminal history. The National Institute of Justice found that up to 70% of formerly incarcerated individuals will recidivate in three years, due in part to these economic obstacles. There is clearly a tremendous need for a shift in public opinion as the current negative public perceptions contribute to an ongoing cycle of insecure economic status and recidivism among the formerly incarcerated population. 
 
 
 
 Defyâ€™s strategy for tackling this challenge is through our unique volunteer and mentoring opportunities, in which we engage community business leaders and executives in service to our mission. The humanizing connections that occur during our events inspire change in the executive volunteers, as they change their perceptions of people with criminal histories and become advocates and fair-chance employers. Their involvement is an important part of what also inspires change amongst our EITs. Both groups feel more human and connected through Defyâ€™s programs and as a result, we shift mindsets and the conversation around criminal histories and second chances.","In Los Angeles, there are a number of organizations doing complementary work to ours. Anti-Recidivism Coalition focuses on reducing recidivism through a number of programs in prison and in the community. Homeboy Industries focuses on providing job and support services for former gang members and previously incarcerated people, and JVS SoCal provides job services to populations that include people with criminal histories. Defy occasionally refers EITs to these organizations if there is a need, and we are working on a formal referral partnership with JVS SoCal. 
 
 
 
 What differentiates Defy from these other organizations is our focus on entrepreneurship. Many formerly incarcerated individuals may have engaged in illegal entrepreneurial ventures before their incarceration, and Defy leverages this drive and talent toward the creation of legal pursuits. Defyâ€™s unique focus on entrepreneurship provides EITs with the option for self-employment, which creates opportunities to earn a sustainable income rather than being stuck in low-wage employment. However, Defy recognizes that not every EIT will become a business owner; a significant portion of our curriculum includes career readiness and personal development work that provides EITs with skills necessary to be effective in their careers. Most importantly, our program restores the confidence of our EITs, which is often lost through their dehumanization behind bars. It also provides the opportunity to uncover and redirect their personal and professional assets and leadership ability, either as an entrepreneur or employee. In addition, Defy was built for replication and scalability and our programs are available in six states across the country.","Defy measures the success of our program both quantitatively and qualitatively. We have well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the reach and effectiveness of our program, as well as additional measures that we track that are important to our program. We also collect stories and testimonials from individuals impacted by our program. 
 
 
 
 Our KPIs for our in-prison program are enrollment, graduation rate, final exam passage rate, Net Promoter Score (survey) among EITs and correctional staff, volunteer involvement, and EIT program satisfaction (survey). We also track EIT well-being (based on survey instrument).
 
 
 
 Our post-release program KPIs are volunteer numbers, EIT engagement, employment, recidivism, program satisfaction, and incubator completion. We also track business launched and other business startup metrics.
 
 
 
 We also look for qualitative feedback about our program from EITs, volunteers, prison administration and staff, and others who are involved with Defy both through surveys and in-person interviews. Our staff members who have regular, direct contact with our EITs gain insight into the value our program is providing in real time.

 While at California State Prison, Solano, Quan Huynh enrolled in the first-ever Defy cohort. Quan was arrested multiple times as a gang member and served 22 years in correctional facilitiesâ€”both juvenile detention and prison. He was serving a 15-to-life sentence for murder when he joined Defyâ€™s program. 
 
 
 
 Quan had decided he wanted to turn his life around and leave behind a positive legacy, even if he only had the opportunity to do it behind bars. While incarcerated, he became certified as an addiction specialist and served as a team coordinator with the Alternatives to Violence Project. One afternoon, a friend who had come back from a presentation told Quan he â€œhad to check out Defy.â€ With its focus on entrepreneurship, transformation, and redemption, Defy seemed like a perfect fit for Quan. 
 
 
 
 Quan paroled to LA County after 16.5 years and before finishing Defyâ€™s program, which he completed after his release. Six months later, he launched his business, Jade Janitors, Inc., after placing in Defyâ€™s business pitch competitions. In 2018, Quan earned almost $130K in revenue and employed seven people, five of whom are formerly incarcerated. Quan also helped create his familyâ€™s business, Monarch 9 Cafe, from concept to daily operations nine months after his release. Defy gave Quan access to a robust community of mentors and supporters, who helped him along his entrepreneurial journey and led to him attending MasterMind Talks, which opened up speaking opportunities and a chance to start writing a book about his experiences.
 
 
 
 Today, Quan is paying it forward and serves as Defyâ€™s post-release program manager for Southern California. At Defy, Quan supports EITsâ€™ success by developing partnerships with service providers, facilitating EITsâ€™ learning, and connecting them to networks and resources.

 Defy uses an â€œinside-outâ€ model to combat the factors contributing to cycles of recidivism and poverty plaguing the 43,000+ Angelenos with criminal histories who struggle to find work and a legal, sustainable livelihood. We leverage the entrepreneurial spirit and talents of people with criminal histories and provide them with the tools and skills to redirect their talents toward legal businesses and jobs. With the support of LA2050 grant funds, Defy will serve over 100 Entrepreneurs in Training (EITs) in LA Country with our full life-cycle of programs. 
 
 
 
 Defyâ€™s program begins on the insideâ€”in prisonsâ€”where we engage classes of EITs in our CEO of Your New Life (CEO YNL) program. With grant funds, we will begin our sixth class of 60 EITs at California State Prison, Los Angeles County (LAC) in August 2019.
 
 
 
 CEO YNL is a 7-month program consisting of 1,200 pages of proprietary curriculum content, supplementary video-based instruction, regular classes and peer discussion, exciting events with executive volunteers, mentorship and coaching, and the creation of deliverables including a resume, personal statement, and business concept plan. CEO YNL culminates in a Shark Tank-style pitch competition and cap and gown graduation, after which EITs earn a certificate of completion. Our program model is aligned with the evidence-based conceptual framework â€œ5-Key Model for Reentry,â€ which focuses on elements of well-being for returning citizens: meaningful work trajectories, healthy thinking habits, positive coping strategies, positive social activities, and positive social relationships.
 
 
 
 Defy is also partnering with two LA transitional facilities (where EITs are no longer in prison and are reentering society), one for men and one for women, to provide the CEO YNL program. With grant funds, we can launch another class of 25 EITs as early as June 2019.
 
 
 
 Once released from prison and graduated from CEO YNL, EITs have the opportunity to enroll in Defyâ€™s post-release program, which further eases the reentry process and trains them to gain and sustain meaningful employment (through workshops and events), develop and launch profitable businesses (through an incubator program), and become more engaged family and community members. 
 
 
 
 Defyâ€™s programs support strong economic outcomes, a decrease in recidivism, and increased well-being for participants, volunteers, and the communities in which they live. The employment rate of Defy graduates is more than 82%, and their return-to-prison rate is less than 5%, as opposed to an average of more than 50% for formerly incarcerated individuals in California.",,,Active,CREATE,,,Voting Period,

 Steve Bryson, a BREATHE LA Board Member, gives both his time and financial support to our organization. Steveâ€™s dedication to improving lung health is inspired by his fatherâ€™s lifelong battle with severe asthma. His fatherâ€™s asthma not only impacted his life as a child, but also affected his adult life when he came to live with Steve and his family during his worst struggles with a progressive disease. This personal experience galvanized Steveâ€™s belief in BREATHE LAâ€™s mission and serves as inspiration for our work. 
 
 
 
 One of our Health Educators recently shared a story about a student in one of our Long Beach after-school programs, O24UÂ®.

We can influence other people to make a cleaner, so it wonâ€™t harm your body.â€ The ability to raise awareness, make connections, share knowledge, and improve well-being all came together in this simple reflection of what was learned in an after-school program. It validated the numerous factors and tools our Health Educators consider when developing curricula and creating meaningful activities for students.

As we grow and expand, LACP can no longer rely solely on volunteers. Having paid staff is critical to our sustainability. We recently hired a part-time administrative assistant, and we have someone in mind to potentially be a program director. LACP is identifying ways of utilizing partner agencies to provide greater wrap-around services. LACP is also in need of new board members. The past yearsâ€™ success has been a telling time. Members who were part of LACP in the beginning found it difficult to manage the time commitments required of a fully-fledged nonprofit and decided to leave the board. We have secured one new member who is excited, committed, and ready to assist with anything LACP. However, LACP is continuing to search for additional new members that can help grow our organization and realize our vision of improving outcomes for vulnerable, disadvantaged Lancaster youth.","At this time, there are no other organizations in the City of Lancaster that have the capacity to do what Lost Angels Children's Project is accomplishing. LACP fills a gap in providing after-school services, as well as for job training opportunities for youth. 
 
 
 
 The need for LACP services is at an all-time high. Foster care and economically disadvantaged youth are at-risk of poor outcomesâ€”developmentally and socially. Most students served at LACP have experienced traumatic events that have led them into their current living situations. It is well documented, and â€œstudies have pointed to the deleterious impact of foster care on children's physical health, cognitive and academic functioning, and social-emotional wellbeing.â€ Worse yet, research has shown that a third of foster youth do not complete high school, less than 50% are employed after aging out of the system, 25% will be incarcerated within the first two-years of leaving the system, and nearly a quarter of youth report homelessness after leaving foster care. The Antelope Valley, in LA County Service Planning Area (SPA) 1, has the highest rates of child abuse, neglect, and foster homes in the County. Homelessness is also at crisis levels with one of the highest rates of youth under the age of 18 living on the streets in the County, of which the majority of youth are Hispanic (35%), and African American (34%).
 
 
 
 LACP offers stability, consistency and support with staff who understand what these students are going through and have the compassion to assist in any way they can to improve youth quality of life.","LACP is committed to empowering youth through services that foster creativity and impart useful skills necessary to elevate students beyond their present condition to become positive participants in their community and transform their lives for a successful future. LACP collects testimonial evidence, tests students on their progress, tracks graduation rates, and is working on a system to monitor grades and school outcomes. Staff work one-on-one with students and their parents/guardians to ensure their individual and academic needs are being met. LACP tests students after workshops to measure knowledge and improved learning. Currently 100% of students have been passing their tests and, in the past year, 90% of LACP students graduated high school.","Funding from LA2050 would strengthen LACP's infrastructure by assisting with expenses for staff and equipment. Our organization is growing and we need additional personnel to implement programs, conduct outreach, and sustain marketing efforts. As LACP looks at ways of generating additional revenue, we will need more equipment for providing hands-on vocational training workshops. The LA2050 Grants Challenge has provided LACP with incredible resources in the past, including funding, connections, marketing, and new opportunities. We hope to partner once again and further promote Los Angeles as one of the best places to Learn and Create.

The car was then raffled off at the Ventura Nationals, a yearly event for classic car enthusiasts, and the poster sale proceeds were donated to support youth programs at local homeless shelters. In 2015, LACP repeated the process by restoring a 1936 Ford Coupe. Each of these cars raised over $40,000 through the giveaway event. Mr. Valencia saw firsthand the difference the restoration project made to the young participantsâ€™ self-confidence and motivation and decided to concentrate his efforts on giving more kids the chance to get involved in this productive, character-building experience. In January 2016, LACP was incorporated and its revenue generating model of vocational job training through classic car restoration has helped to sustain services year after year. That year, LACP won a 2016 LA2050 Challenge Grant as one of the Best Places to Learn in Los Angeles. This grant was instrumental in launching LACP to the next level and our organization was able to leverage this support for gaining new donors, funders and resources. In 2017, LACP experienced a great amount of success in securing grants to further build organizational infrastructure. Among these, a Springboard Fund start-up grant from The Durfee Foundation provided two-years of funding and a personal mentor. Executive Director Steve LePore, who has over 30 years of experience working with non-profit organizations, has been providing one-on-one support and guidance for Mr. Valencia to help develop LACP. In addition, Mr. Valencia was recognized with a CNN Hero Award in December 2017 for his work and dedication; and this success was leveraged to grow LACP from a small workshop to a 5,000 square foot facility in the heart of Lancaster.","While this is not a collaborative proposal, LACP partners with a number of agencies to strengthen programs, infrastructure and sustainability. 
 
 
 
 LACP has had a great deal of success in partnering with organizations to receive in-kind donations and resources, including car parts, professional lifts, and monetary donations to support program. As our organization has grown, we have developed new partnerships that include but are not limited to the Lancaster Police Department, City of Lancaster, and other local stakeholders. The Lancaster Museum of Art and History (MOAH) has provided in-kind space for LACP to do an exhibition of youth art work. LACP also worked with a local silkscreen shop to provide lessons to students and have them design their own line of t-shirtsâ€”opening a prospective avenue for social enterprise at LACP. We are also working on a partnership with United Community Action Network (UCAN), that may enable LACP to expand its reach to working with juveniles on probation.",aaron@lostangelscp.org,Aaron Valencia,661-406-3681,[],[],[],[],Non-profit organization,"['Yes, in 2016']",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,@lostangelscp,@lost_angels_childrens_project,@LostAngelsCP,https://www.lostangelscp.org,https://www.lostangelscp.org,['LA2050 newsletter'],0-5 employees,No,,"['Youth unemployment and underemployment', 'Student education pipeline']","['LA is the best place to CREATE', 'LA is the best place to PLAY']",[],[],LANCASTER,45059 TREVOR AVENUE,47-3384907,Â Lost Angels Children's ProjectÂ,California,93534,[],[],,https://www.lostangelscp.org/donate,https://www.lostangelscp.org/contact,Vocational Training for At-Risk and Foster Youth,LA is the best place to LEARN,"$100,000-$500,000",,"LACP offers two-hour Classic Car Restoration and Customization workshops for students to gain a complete understanding of all facets of automotive repair and creative design. The skills acquired in workshops include but are not limited to: frame and suspension, bleeding brakes, checking tire pressure/changing tires, motor and transmission removal and repair, wiring/electrical charging system, paint and body work, sheet metal fabrication, welding/cutting, and creating new body panels. During restoration, students troubleshoot and mitigate challenges that arise, which promote science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education. LACP helps students understand how the skills learned in workshops can be turned into a pathway to finding jobs and gratifying work in a field they enjoy. Problem solving, critical thinking and team building are essential components in the LACP workshops, as well as learning a code of conduct that teaches each student the principles of accountability, manners, respect and gratitude. 
 
 
 
 Within the Antelope Valley, LACP focuses on youth in the City of Lancasterâ€”where nearly 23% of households live below the poverty level and 30% of residents are under the age of 18. Twenty percent of the population has less than a high school education, and only 15% of the residents have education higher than a bachelorâ€™s degree (compared to 30% in LA County). Of LACPâ€™s students, 70% are African American, 25% are Hispanic, and 5% are other ethnicities; 70% are male and 30% are female; 100% are low-income and at-risk; and 84% are part of the foster care system. LACP workshops host 10-15 students per session; and, all participants are served a nutritious meal â€” for some, this is the only healthy food they get during the day. 
 
 
 
 LACP programs will make measurable progress toward making LA the best place to LEARN by accomplishing the following:
 
 * A minimum of 50 youth will gain hands-on vocational training in the automotive industry.
 
 * Youth will have a safe atmosphere for learning and expressing themselves through creative outlets that are non-violent and promote positive communication.
 
 * LACP workshops will provide after-school opportunities that prevent youth from gang activity, substance use/abuse, and teenage pregnancy.
 
 * Youth participants will engage with positive mentors and role models that have overcome great obstacles and can demonstrate a pathway to a successful future.
 
 * Youth will be encouraged to stay in school, reduce truancies and tardies, and will have an enhanced understanding of STEAM subjects through hands-on application in the workshops. 
 
 * Youth will gain experience that lends to greater prospects for immediate employment in the automotive industry, including but not limited to dealerships and maintenance providers. 
 
 * Students will feel empowered, experience better self-esteem and become more self-reliant by learning skills that can translate into jobs and future learning opportunities.",,,,Active,LEARN,,,Voting Period,
2881527409,Safecast,Volunteer centered open environmental monitoring. More freely available open data is better for everyone. Our work is aimed at putting data & collection in the hands of people.,"Our primary barrier for this proposal has been the funding to build and deploy air sensors in Los Angeles. As a global project originally formed in the wake of a nuclear disaster a lot of our funding focuses on Asia and radiation issues. Having a personal connection to Los Angeles means this project is very important to us and we continue to work to find funding to get this underway, through grants and individual donations.","There are many other organizations and device manufacturers with attention on air quality, however none with the commitment to open data and with the global reach of Safecast. Most projects are hyperlocal and generate closed data, ensuring that it's unhelpful to anyone outside of their project or locking people into long term service contracts. By generating data that we put into the public domain, and by creating global consistency we are building a resource that will be valuable and useful for generations to come.
 
 Air Beam, Purple Air and Public Labs are examples of smaller scale complimentary efforts.",We push for open source standards and greater data transparency that enables communities to produce personally relevant environmental data. With 20 sensors Safecast has collected more than 1.1 million air quality measurements in Los Angeles in under 3 years. Success as part of LA2050 means improved access to neighborhood-level air quality readings. Weâ€™d like to reach 5 million air quality measurements in the first year - but more importantly success will be measured in how many people gained access to and use their data.,"The only hard cost for this proposal is the hardware as our volunteer community manage all other aspects. Our current per device cost is approximately $1500 putting 75 sensors (73 needed to place one at each branch) at $112,500 however we currently build devices in small batches of 10-20 at a time. We're confident that with larger bulk purchases of individual parts we can bring the cost closer to $1200 per device bringing the cost of 75 to $90,000 leaving us an extra $10k for local shipping or any additional costs that arise at the time of installation.",We actively receive unrestricted private donations that we can use for unexpected costs on various projects.,"['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","Following on our previous air quality monitoring of Los Angeles, we are working to install next generation air sensors at public library branches throughout the city. In addition to the sensors and the real time data they will provide to communities, we are developing curriculum and workshops for neighborhoods and communities to better understand their environment.","['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"We launched Safecast immediately after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami which struck Japan and the subsequent meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Initially a reaction to the lack of data available, we quickly began monitoring, collecting, and openly sharing information on environmental radiation, growing quickly in size, scope, and geographical reach. After the publication of our data evacuation areas in Japan were changed and countless families used the data to decide if they should relocate or not.
 
 
 
 Today our radiation data set has reached well over 100 million measurements and is the largest ever of its kind. Safecast data is known to be of excellent quality due to its being unbiased and transparently collected by individual volunteers. Safecast radiation data has been used by individuals to make decisions around their own safety and potential radiation exposure, research scientists, governments, and even artists. In 2018 Popular Mechanics declared that ""Safecast has revolutionized citizen science.""
 
 
 
 Branching our from radiation, in 2017 we deployed our first air quality monitors in and around Los Angeles and have collected and published approximately 1.1 million discrete and verifiable measurements.
 
 
 
 Most importantly, Safecast has enabled people to easily monitor their own homes and environments, and to free themselves of dependence on government and other institutions for this kind of essential information. We are happy to be playing a major continuing role in the emergence of technically competent citizen efforts worldwide.","Initially conceived in 2016, we have been in discussions with the Los Angeles Makerspace on additional ways to incorporate our curriculum to their ongoing efforts and workshops. LAM has partnered with the Los Angeles Public Library on many STEAM and Makerspace projects, now hosting regular workshops out of library branches. These relationships led to the discussion of installing sensors at the branches and adding Safecast curriculum to the current offerings. Technically, LAPL will provide the locations for the sensors and LAM will facilitate workshops led by Safecast volunteers.
 
 
 
 These partnerships allow Safecast to expand the intervention of local volunteer data use and monitoring in LA by bringing additional sensors to communities where individuals are not likely to otherwise afford the devices or do not have internet connections to access and use the Safecast air quality data set.",sean@safecast.org,Sean Bonner,213-446-3315,[],[],[],[],Non-profit organization,"['Yes, in 2014']","https://www.facebook.com/LAMakerspace/

Unfortunately, air quality data is limited: current public measurements are too generalized to give accurate information as sensors arenâ€™t located where people live but at government facilities. Air quality data is normally not transparent enough for people to make informed personal health decisions. This proposal to expands our existing open source air quality data set through a network of connected environmental monitoring sensors based at each of the 73 branches of the LA Public Library with the following objectives:
 
 
 
 â€¢ Promote neighborhood science that empowers individuals and communities in their personal health decision making
 
 â€¢ Further develop a comprehensive data set showing trends in LA air quality by neighborhood
 
 â€¢ Document the effect open source environmental data collection and environmental data use has on individualsâ€™ and communitiesâ€™ abilities to access public services, interact with local governments, and positively affect an individualâ€™s personal choices to address climate change
 
 
 
 LAPL branches are trusted community hubs serving more than 4 million Angelenos last year. LAPLâ€™s goal is to serve all neighborhoods equally, however, poorer neighborhoods make use of library services to a much greater degree than affluent ones. LAPL reports that 32% of library patrons do not have connectivity outside of the library. 60% of the people using library-based STEAM programs serve are low income, 53% are Latinx, and 12% African American. 
 
 
 
 Watts, a predominantly Latinx neighborhood with a significant African American population, has two library branches serving two zip codes. The Mark Twain Branch is adjacent to the 110 freeway and the Alma Reaves Woods Branch is located near a park. By increasing air quality monitoring in these two locations, Watts residents will have real-time particulate matter readings at these two sites. With greater granularity we can see changing PM patterns and communicate findings immediately and directly. Safecastâ€™s 24 hour and 30 day mapped visualizations allow residents to see how markedly air quality changes from one location to another and what emerging trends are occurring.
 
 
 
 Our partnership with LAPL means we can bring additional sensors to communities where people may not otherwise be able to afford the devices or do not have internet connections to access and use the Safecast air quality data set. Safecast will publicize real-time measurements to all library patrons and will provide data and environmental literacy modules supporting LAPLâ€™s technology programs. These two activities will integrate the data into residentâ€™s everyday lives.

2929529569,B~STEM Project Foundation,B~STEM Projectâ€™s primary goal is to provide young people with a comprehensive and interdisciplinary experience with business and STEM disciplines.,"The biggest challenge is funding the program, as it is free to participants. We want to ensure that the experience is available to all female emerging talent. Particularly those from underserved and low-income communities. Thus, we are looking to partner with organizations like LA2050 to help solve this major challenge.","There are quite a few organizations and initiatives that focus on coding, such as Girls Who Code, Black Girls Who Code, Girls Inc. CoderDojo, Made with Code, and the like. They have similar goals in terms of educating girls and young women for careers in programming, but with a much narrower scope. There are also STEM-driven organizations, such as Brainy Girls, Center for STEM Education for Girls, Math Doesnâ€™t Suck, and Engineer Girl. However, B~STEM Project emphasizes the presence of STEM in every industry. For us, â€œSTEM is Everywhereâ€ and we intend to do more than teach technical skills. We introduce emerging talent into the entire professional ecosystem, where both â€œhardâ€ and â€œsoftâ€ skills are necessary for successful careers. We take this holistic approach to broaden studentsâ€™ lenses and multiply their opportunities.
 
 
 
 Additionally, education must include exploration and experiential learningâ€”and lead to the discovery of oneâ€™s purpose. As such, we do not steer young people into STEM-specific fields; rather, we expose them to the unlimited possibilities for leveraging STEM in any environment.
 
 Oftentimes, young women are not even aware of these possibilities. Therefore, career decisions are made without full knowledge of all the options. With better education and more exposure, talented young women will make more informed educational and professional choicesâ€”and discover disciplines that pique their curiosity.
 
 With heightened career awareness, enhanced technical ability, and a forum in which to apply their learning, participants improve their opportunities to become productive citizens. Professional mentors provide guidance and give participants the freedom to ask questions and gain a clearer understanding of what it takes to succeed. (Seeing living and breathing examples of what is possible is empowering.) 
 
 
 
 Although B~STEM Project offers its own specialized programming, we also partner strategically with other community organizations to deliver services. We identify partners that share our mission, or key aspects of it, and collaborate with them. These relationships foster synergistic activities and broaden our programmatic reach. Powerful alliances of community changemakers dedicated to empowering youth have the best chance of making a tangible and lasting impact. 
 
 B~STEM, and its partners, innovate by modifying, expanding, and transforming existing activitiesâ€”as well as by inventing new ones. 
 
 We are continuously looking for ways to expose emerging female talent to new and exciting educational experiences. Every program is a rare opportunity to ignite the genius that will, one day, change lives.","Since 2016, B~STEM Project has engaged 3,010 participants, administered 2,121 hours of programming, and supported 1,501 projects developed by our emerging talent. Our programs provide workforce preparation and youth development. (Both are necessary when cultivating talent for success.) In addition, we provide a safe and supportive environment where youth are encouraged to ask questions and venture into the unknown. Even more importantly, we ensure that participants develop valuable relationships with peers and professionals. We expose young girls and women to transformational growth opportunitiesâ€”and we understand that exploration promotes learning, creativity, and innovation. 
 
 
 
 Through our hands-on and online components, we have been able to expand our reach. Through our social communities, YouTube ambassadors, thought-leaders and celebrity supporters, we are increasingly amplifying our mission. With their support, our direct impressions have reached over 20 million. We also strive to quantify and qualify our programsâ€™ impact. Throughout the entire process, we survey studentsâ€™ knowledge and understanding. This occurs during our online application process and through on-site surveys before and after learning sessions. We also interview and survey our partners, and our professional participants, to gain important insights about our program. In short, we are committed to amassing qualitative and quantitative data about our performanceâ€”and leveraging this data to provide more effective programs.","EXPENSES - LEGAL (TOTAL: $8,700.00)

At B~STEM, we believe that all students need to develop confidence with STEM disciplines to become successful, and well-rounded adults, in the 21st-century. Therefore, we offer unique programs with a broad range of activities. We give participants an opportunity to see STEM through a creative and accessible lensâ€”and develop leadership skills that will be relevant to any career.
 
 While our fashion, music and sports programs engage students with diverse academic interestsâ€”including those with interests in non-STEM careersâ€”our program introduces participants to the critical role math, science, technology, and engineering play in all disciplines. Also, along with our hackathons and game development workshops, these programs allow participants to gain insights about all aspects of product development, including ideation, prototyping, design, user-testing, marketing, branding, financing, and business strategies. Students learn how to conceive and design productsâ€”taking their creative concepts from ideation to iteration.
 
 
 
 Another key factor in our success is our collaboration with leading companies, such as Microsoft, Verizon, Leo Burnett, YouTube, Morgan Stanley, Motorola, Samsung and many more.

This requires a cultural shift in Metro and local transportation departments that our project seeks to advance by forging community and political support. This campaign is vital for us to strategize with our public sector, resource and community engagement partners to activate and advance our efforts for Angelenos to connect and live. 
 
 
 
 We will pair community stories with the successes of bus lines that already run in bus only lanes such as the Dodger Stadium Express s and the Metro Orange and Silver Line buses, which run on-time 9 times out of 10, to show the true potential of dedicated bus lanes in LA. By amplifying community stories and continuing our advocacy efforts through this funded campaign we support elected officials who have the authority to push public agencies to change their usual transportation planning methods.","Our organization convenes a dedicated bus lane working group to build on the passions and ideas of our project partners. While all our partner organizations work on enhancing mobility in LA from different angles -- equity, the environment, and business, for example -- we all agree that a network of dedicated bus lanes would free Angelenos stuck in traffic. Our coalition needs a funded campaign to forge a productive community and political partnership for dedicated bus lanes.","Our partnership envisions improving access for people riding the bus in the City of Los Angeles. LA Metro, LADOT, and staff from the office of the Mayor Eric Garcetti have targeted implementing a bus lane by the end of the year (2019).

 Quantifiable goals to support this outcome include:
 
 Install 5 or more miles of dedicated bus lanes on peak hour-prohibited parking lanes in the City of Los Angeles by 2020
 
 Increase bus on-time performance in newly dedicated bus only lanes by 20% percent from one year earlier

This project team will leverage the trust the project team has built with elected officials and community members to launch a bus service for all that inexpensively removes people stuck in traffic.,['City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)'],Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"Close your eyes and picture the last minivan commercial you saw. You may remember seeing a cleancut, youngish, but not too hip woman, handling life with ease behind the wheel. And thatâ€™s because our societal culture (and mainstream marketing) assumes, encourages, and expects women to be the primary members of the household that are running errands (trunk space!), managing kidsâ€™ travel needs (safety!), and making more trips because of it (mileage!). And more often than not, this is true. Of the few data points available for how women in the U.S. and Los Angeles travel, we know this: Women travel in similar modes than men, but travel shorter distances and make more trips. Women, particularly low-wage and shift workers, are also more likely to travel during off-peak hours (outside of the morning and evening â€œrush hourâ€ periods). And minivan commercials aside, women are also more likely to use public transportation.
 
 
 
 So why isnâ€™t our transportation system better designed for half the population, who are making more trips? Investing in Place positions mobility needs of women and mothers as a transportation priority. We released a video about a momâ€™s travel on the bus, moderated several panels on women and transportation, and are working pro bono with Metro on a study to better understand how women travel. And just last month, our deputy director, Naomi Iwasaki advanced the conversation about women in transportation at the Mt. St. Maryâ€™s Report on the Status of Women and Girls Release Event, which was attended by over 500 people including California First Partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom and California State Senator Holly Mitchell.
 
 
 
 Our pop up bus lanes tangibly demonstrate the freedom of getting places without the aggravation of traffic. Bus only lanes connect communities and can transform the lived experience of everyone in LA, especially moms and their families who rely on public transportation in LA. We will leverage the successes of dedicated bus lane service like the Dodger Stadium Express -- which has carried over a million fans to Dodger Stadium since 2016 -- to show how dedicated bus lanes can get people to places quickly and reliably without needing a private automobile.","Investing in Place will serve as the project manager of this four-part team.

On a report card, Metroâ€™s bus on-time performance statistic would earn Metro a C because only seven in 10 Metro buses pick-up passengers â€œon-time.â€ By Metroâ€™s own data, this means three in 10 buses run late or, worse, donâ€™t show up at all.
 
  
 
 Solution - Investing in Place proposes to support an advocacy campaign for the implementation of dedicated bus lanes in the City of Los Angeles to speed up buses and improve their reliability. This partnership has a shared and intended relative short-term outcome of improving access for people riding the bus in the City of Los Angeles and thereby increasing public transit ridership. According to a report by the UCLA Institute of Transportation Studies, if 1 in 4 people who rarely or never ride transit replaced one driving trip with one transit trip every two weeks, annual ridership would grow by 96 million. The small change of dedicated bus lanes can result in an outsized impact by creating a more reliable, accessible, and faster transit experience for bus riders.

While participation is included in each program graduate's aftercare plan, graduates are not always initially interested, may lose interest over time, or they move, or don't have the time to participate. We have a couple of strategies for overcoming this challenge. 
 
 
 
 One strategy is ensuring a variety of fun social activities and volunteer and mentorship opportunities for program graduates to involve themselves with. 
 
 
 
 Social activities include:
 
 
 
 - Participation in our running club, which runs races and marathons all over the world
 
 - Participation on our basketball team
 
 - Use of our on-site gym, trainers & coaches
 
 - Exclusive field trips
 
 - Parties for events & holidays, like our annual Independence Day BBQ and Super Bowl Party
 
 - Tickets to sporting events, which are donated by our supporters
 
 
 
 Volunteer & mentorship activities include:
 
 
 
 - Volunteering at our community events in Skid Row, like our holiday street festivals
 
 - Volunteering at our special events, like our Golf Tournament and Gala
 
 - Volunteer meal services & special projects around our three facilities
 
 - Sponsoring someone currently in one of our programs 
 
 - Speaking opportunities at our All House Meetings & other recognition events for program participants
 
 
 
 Another strategy, for those who simply cannot participate in the alumni network, is to stay in touch with those program graduates and survey them so we can stay up to date on how they're doing and evaluate the effectiveness of our aftercare plans.","To our knowledge, there is no other organization applying the 12-step principles to ""life after homelessness.""","If the Recovery from Homelessness project prevents future episodes of homelessness for those in our alumni network and gives them the tools they need to maintain self-sufficiency (personal wellbeing, employment & housing), we will consider the project a success. 
 
 
 
 We will measure success by conducting participant satisfaction surveys biannually. We will also create and track critical success factors, including the number of those in our alumni network who:
 
 
 
 - Are actively participating in the alumni network (Goal: 100)
 
 - Are stably housed (Goal: 100%)
 
 - Are employed (Goal: 100%)
 
 - Increased their income (Goal: 25%)
 
 - Reunited with family, where applicable
 
 - Are participating in TMM social activities (Goal: 100%)
 
 - Are involved in TMM volunteer & mentorship opportunities (Goal: 100%)
 
 - Have improved their mental health, which will be measured using the Beck Anxiety & Depression Inventory Scale (Goal: 100%)

In the 1920s, TMM dropped its religious affiliation, opening up its services to everybody in need. Over time, the Skid Row community's demographics and needs changed, and TMM expanded its program services in response. Now, in addition to serving more than 1 million meals per year to the homeless and low income community and sheltering up to 1,000 people per night across our three locations, we offer numerous life-changing & life-saving services, including drug & alcohol recovery, family living, case management, education & workforce development, and physical & mental health services.
 
 
 
 One person whose life was profoundly changed by TMM is Rebecca. Rebecca never dreamed that she and her young son would end up homeless. She had all the ingredients necessary to live a happy, successful life - a college degree, a good job at Boeing - but she developed a drug problem and was unable to stop. Eventually, she lost everything and she and her son ended up on the streets. ""With God's loving grace and a lot of hard work,"" as she puts it, she was able to get sober and it was then that she started to pick up the pieces of her life. She got a full-time job at a restaurant, but still couldn't afford her own apartment. She and her son were living in horrible conditions. Fortunately, a friend told her about TMM's Family Living program, and she turned to them for help. She was given a case manager who created a plan for her to become successful in every area of her life - sobriety, family & employment. While in the program, she completed school to become a surgical technologist while working as a barista and saving money. When she graduated from the program, she found rewarding work immediately at a hospital. Her son is thriving, involved with little league, camp and swimming. He doesn't remember the struggles they faced together when he was a toddler. In fact, his memories of TMM's Family Living program are those of a loving home - not a traumatic shelter.

Most of those in this program suffer from drug, alcohol, & other addictions. The program incorporates the 12-step philosophy commonly used in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), combined with case management plans, which provide the tools needed to achieve & maintain self-sufficiency. Because the 12 steps are actually principles for living, rather than just a tool to overcome addiction, we have begun to apply the 12-step philosophy as â€œstepsâ€ for those on their journey to being housed. We are also applying this 12-step process as a way to address ""life after homelessness"" for those who have become stably housed & are now part of our alumni network.
 
 
 
 Our alumni network keeps graduates of our programs connected to each other, our staff, & TMM's services and resources, with the goal of preventing future episodes of homelessness. TMM has seen that living happily and successfully after experiencing homelessness is highly dependent upon one's general wellbeing, ability to prioritize lifeâ€™s challenges, & moving in a positive direction, all of which the 12 steps effectively address. 
 
 
 
 To execute the Recovery from Homelessness project, TMM will employ the 12-step philosophy in program participantsâ€™ aftercare plans, & hold regular support meetings for program alumni that incorporate 12-step ideas. 
 
 
 
 TMM's Recovery from Homelessness project will benefit individuals & families who are currently receiving shelter & services as well as those who have graduated from our programs & have exited to stable housing.

TMM will collect surveys & critical success factor data & use it to evaluate the projectâ€™s effectiveness after one year of implementation.
 
 
 
 The Recovery from Homelessness project prevents future episodes of homelessness by using a 12-step process that provides support, encouragement & accountability for people who want to overcome their barriers to success. Each participant will identify their own â€œsteps,â€ based loosely on AA. For example: Acknowledging that life is unmanageable because of homelessness, that homelessness may not be immediately overcome, that we can inventory & account for our actions that led to homelessness, that we can forgive ourselves for our past mistakes & identify potential mistakes before we make them, that once we are stable, we should help those still struggling.

County are so low is a severe lack of resources, including time and money for training, education, classroom presentations, and voter registration drives. 
 
 
 
 Teachers are already overburdened, and many students donâ€™t necessarily understand how to participate effectively or even how public decisions affect them on a daily basis. Many parents in LA County are new residents and citizens who may not have the familiarity with US political institutions to help guide their children. 
 
 
 
 The Civics Center will help fill this gap in this critical area of our youthâ€™s civics education by providing volunteers to recruit, train, and educate student leaders and by supporting the educators advising those students. 
 
 
 
 The Civics Center also will provide micro-grants to schools in underserved communities to ensure students in those communities have the resources necessary to organize voter registration drives at their schools.","While other organizations focus on activating and registering young voters in the 18 to 24-year-old bracket, few target 16- and 17-year-olds for preregistration. Of those who do, no single organization has developed a comprehensive strategy to reach this demographic and provide the resources necessary to give them the opportunity to preregister to vote. Capturing registrations before students graduate from high school and are met with new sets of demands is ideal. The Civics Center (TCC) aims to coordinate with other groups currently working on youth voter registration to leverage and increase our impact while also creating lasting organizing structures and connections for future efforts.
 
 
 
 TCC has already worked in different and complementary ways to integrate efforts with numerous groups, including Power California, the League of Women Voters, the American Constitution Society, the Dialogues on Freedom project (sponsored by the LA County Bar Association and the Constitutional Rights Foundation), Future of California Elections, and Every Vote Counts. 
 
 
 
 With the exception of Power California, none of these organizations focuses on developing the infrastructure to promote peer-to-peer voter registration and preregistration in high schools. 
 
 Power California is an organization that we admire and with which we have developed a positive relationship. Power California promotes voter registration and preregistration with an aim of mobilizing communities around particular issues and causes. The Civics Center is seeking to engage with a broad range of high schools and their students in promoting youth voter registrations. Power California primarily works one-on-one with individual schools. TCC primarily trains students from a number of schools simultaneously through in-person workshops and Google hangout webinars open and available to students from any LA County high school. 
 
 
 
 We are able to provide Power California members with our materials and resources, and they may be able to assist us with their trained volunteers. They have already attended one of our training sessions, and we are working with them in training and supporting students at Centennial High School in Compton.
 
 
 
 Similarly, the League of Women Voters has positive connections with many schools and we have featured links to some of their training materials on our website. 
 
 
 
 We have co-sponsored events with Every Vote Counts and the American Constitution Society, and have promoted voter registration through the Dialogues on Freedom program. 
 
 
 
 Finally, TCC intends to work with the LA County Registrar, LAUSD, and other County school districts to implement policies that support high school student voter registration. 
 
 
 
 Whether faculty guidance and advice is sparked by our contacts or others, TCC is eager to provide trainings, educational resources, and/or micro-grants to help maximize the impact of high school registration drives. Our goal is to empower the students (with appropriate faculty advice and guidance) to organize and run their own drives while creating the infrastructure in schools to support voter registration and civic engagement from year to year.","We define success for our project as creating the infrastructure to promote youth voter registration and preregistration. We provide the resources and motivation and connections for schools, students and groups to successfully run registration drives. We will measure the following outcomes:

 The 2016 election highlighted many challenges to democracy. These include low rates of voter turnout and civic engagement, especially among young people. In the 2014 midterms, fewer than 10% Californians ages 18-24 voted. Only 50% of people ages 18-29 voted in the 2016 Presidential election.
 
 
 
 We often hear that young people donâ€™t register and vote because they are apathetic. But young people care deeply, not just about their social media status, but also about climate change, education, college affordability, jobs, health care, and racial, gender and LGBT equality.
 
 
 
 As a lawyer and a parent, I began to ask, what if we as community leaders have failed to make voting accessible to young people? What if theyâ€™re just waiting to be asked?
 
 
 
 With an incredible group of volunteers and supporters, I started The Civics Center to 
 
 provide students, teachers, and administrators simple resources and basic training, to participate in civic life by leading voter registration drives. It turns out all we had to do was ask. And this is what we heard:
 
 
 
 â€œI received and read your email last Aprilâ€¦. I used the information at my school to instill the voting process, purpose, and passion voting promotes in our country.

 High schools can provide the ideal educational and organizing framework through which to promote a culture of voting among young people. School clubs, which can continue from year to year, support peer-led efforts, helping teenagers develop leadership abilities and promoting social bonds while working toward common goals of voter registration and civic participation. 
 
 The Civics Center (TCC) uses many methods of outreach to contact and engage school communities. These include email messages to teachers and other educators, social media, a newsletter, and website. With additional funding, TCC will reach additional schools, create a model of effective peer-to-peer engagement that can be expanded throughout the County, and promote policies to support youth voter registration. Through in-person and online training workshops, TCC also will identify and train new student leaders to organize registration drives in their respective schools. TCC will provide online resources and a kit we call DEMOCRACY IN A BOX that delivers resources necessary to hold a voter registration drive and an incentive and recognition program to acknowledge and reward schools and students who reach registration goals.
 
 
 
 Population 
 
 All high school students (who can participate in voter registration drives regardless of voting eligibility), and students eligible to preregister or register to vote. Our goal is to distribute DEMOCRACY IN A BOX kits to 250 L.A. County high schools, each of which will pledge to register or preregister at least 100 students. The program has the capacity for substantial impact beyond the immediate population served, including influencing families and communities.
 
 
 
 Timeline 
 
 July-Sept. 2019: Conduct outreach and identify and train student and community volunteers to promote high school voter registration drives in fall 2019. Finalize DEMOCRACY IN A BOX kits and refine system for schools to register with TCC and provide feedback. Support efforts with social media.
 
 
 
 Oct. 2019-Jan. 2020: Refine and expand program to focus schools on registering students before the March 2020 primary election. Assist schools with get-out-the-vote campaigns.
 
 
 
 Feb.-June 2020: Promote the concept that every graduate should be a voter. By June of every year, schools should have encouraged eligible students to register multiple times in multiple ways. Train additional students and faculty to hold voter registration drives in fall 2020. Publish information about TCCâ€™s learning. 
 
 
 
 Measures
 
 TCC will make LA the best place to CONNECT by sparking high school students to create social structures to increase rates of VOLUNTEERISM in the interest of improving VOTER PARTICIPATION while creating a strong civic culture steeped in a tradition of service and citizen responsibility. By increasing preregistration rates in LA County, TCC will help improve youth turnout, and ultimately make GOVERNMENT MORE RESPONSIVE.

The International Business Accelerator,a program of Civic 180, supports SMEs to expand into global markets","Many small businesses operate in silos, cut off from the local community, governments and civic organizations. In the process of recruiting for the six cohorts that the IBA has run, getting in contact with small manufacturers has been the biggest challenge. We will handle this through media relations for print, broadcast and online publications, social media and presentations on exporting at Chambers of Commerce and civic groups (e.g. Rotary).","The California Manufacturing Technology Consulting (https://www.cmtc.com/exporting) works with manufacturing companies on exporting. This program, funded by the US Department of Commerce, typically works with more advanced companies. The IBA Export Accelerator offers more workshops (6 vs 3) and has greater emphasis on cutting-edge technologies such as online marketing, e-commerce, and logistics software as well as global intellectual property protection, cross-border tax and accounting, market research techniques, international contract law and cross-cultural negotiating.","For three chosen metrics (manufacturing, women/minority owned businesses and high-growth startups):
 
 
 
 -- Train 20 companies in the 12 week program (six workshops, follow-up coaching, integrating incentives) We continue to work with the companies after the 12 week program.
 
 
 
 -- Companies will on average start/increase revenues from global sales by $50,000. The goal for the project is to generate at least $1million in global sales from LA County companies.
 
 
 
 -- The 20 companies will on average create one additional direct job. That will create 20 FTEs during the first year.
 
 
 
 -- Based on current ratios for non-durable manufacturing jobs in LA County, we estimate that the 20 direct jobs will generate an additional 60 indirect jobs.

 -- Manufacturing firms in LA County will account for six percent of all establishments countywide, employing 18 percent of the workforce. We do this by not only boosting exports and sales, but fortifying the business for rapid growth.
 
 
 
 -- Los Angeles will nearly double the share of high-growth startups to five percent of the top 5,000 firms nationwide. The IBA and LMU are committed to leveraging the LA205 grant into a perpetual acceleration program for create and accelerator our region's small manufacturers. 
 
 
 
 LMU and the IBA will remain vigilant of meeting other LA2050 Goals such as recruiting and retention rates for higher educational institutions, keeping college graduates in LA County for five years, help founders secure patents and venture capital, increase jobs per capita, including programs helping the formerly incarcerated.

 Using a real-life example from our accelerator, Mary M had local momentum and ready to take on the world, literally and figuratively. Her breakfast and healthy snack products were selling locally, boasted great packaging and branding and our curriculum had her prepared.
 
  
 
 Until she received an initial purchase order from China for multiple 40â€™ x 8â€™ container loads. As a small manufacturer, she couldnâ€™t afford staff and materials to manufacture such an order. She remained focused on the local market and eventually closed the business to take a job to provide insurance for her family. 
 
 
 
 The program weâ€™ve created eliminates this situation for small business owners like Mary M. . 
 
 By focusing on smaller international B2C shipments, small manufacturers like Mary M benefit in three way. First, they keep manufacturing costs stable. Second, they minimize duties and tariffs through special federal programs. Third, they maximize profit margin by selling at full retail pricing.
 
 
 
 We unshackle the small business owner/manufacturer from burdensome capital requirements by focusing on global B2C.
 
 
 
 Add this to the IBA's export accelerator curriculum and network of experts like KPMG for cross-border tax and accounting guidance, global IP attorneys, funding experts and more. 
 
 Our My LA2050 backed program mitigates and removes the burden of a startup selling overseas by enabling maximum profit via small shipments and the know-how to export efficiently, compliantly and profitably. 
 
 
 
 Most importantly, this program ensures owners like Mary M will never be haunted by the what-ifs of unrealized growth and profits.","Loyola Marymount University's College of Business Administration will host the workshops and provide access to expertise and resources ranging from global commerce to enterprise resource planning to leadership training. 
 
 
 
 LMU business school's mission statement is as follows: ""The CBA advances knowledge and develops business leaders with moral courage and creative confidence to be a force for good in the global community."" 
 
 
 
 In addition, it will select four business school students to work as paid interns with each cohort (total of eight) . Professor Anatoly Zhuplev, PhD who teaches International Business & Entrepreneurship will provide oversight for the student interns and will participate in the training workshops and work one-on-one with high growth cross-border businesses.

 The ""Going Global through Small Shipments"" program draws on the methodology and curriculum of the existing IBA Export Accelerator. The twelve week program has six workshops led by IBA staff and industry experts. The topics include:
 
 â€¢ Creating a global company and resources for exporters,
 
 â€¢ Cross-cultural awareness and negotiating strategies,
 
 â€¢ Product readiness (standards, identifying barriers to entry, landed-cost value),
 
 â€¢ Tax, accounting, finance and funding strategies,
 
 â€¢ Legal issues (contracts, intellectual property, HR),
 
 â€¢ Market entry strategy,
 
 
 
 After each workshop, a business coach will work with each company to translate the content into business practices. At the same time, an intern will work with each company to develop a research report tailored for the company's product for a specific country. With the business coach, each company will develop an export strategy for initial sales and future market development.
 
 
 
 As the program progresses, the company will be connected to specific resources and incentives, including logistics providers, de minimis export software tracking, market research resources, agents or distributors in other countries, website design and global marketing analysis. The companies will also be connected to federal programs (US Commercial Service, SBA export finance and EXIM Bank insurance) and California export grant programs (STEP).
 
 
 
 At the end of the program, the companies will present their companies at a Demo Day to an audience of potential customers, industry experts and angel/vc investors.
 
 
 
 The IBA will look to LA 2050 to get the word to LA SMEs that exporting helps the community.
 
 
 
 POPULATION SERVED
 
 
 
 This program is aimed at LA County small business owners that currently are making a product suitable for export. Of the 350,000 SMEs in LA County region, only 12% currently export. Why don't more become involved in global trade? SMEs most frequently cite concerns about risk and paperwork. Those concerns are even greater for women and minority owned businesses. The IBA directly addresses those concerns through its training and coaching process. 
 
 
 
 From its very first cohort, the IBA has made a special effort to reach out to women and minority owned businesses. 60% of the companies the IBA has worked with have women founders and nearly 50% are minority-owned. In recruiting for the two cohorts, we will aim for similar broad diversity to include women, minority and immigrant owned businesses.

Renters, in particular, may not have access to outdoor space where they feel comfortable planting. Children who have grown up in rental housing may have little to no experience with gardening. The program booklet will include step-by-step instructions on how to plant and establish their new garden, with an emphasis on the rewards of mindfulness in caring for other organisms. By engaging whole families in this project, gardening will become a multi-generational activity that draws on the experience and patience of older family members. Access to planting space is another potential obstacle. The plants have been selected for their small size so they will grow in parking strips, narrow beds, or containers, reducing the challenge of finding a place to plant.","The National Wildlife Federationâ€™s Butterfly Heroes program promotes butterfly populations through gardening, with a strong focus on suburban gardens and little support for people who live in urban settings.

She researched the appropriate plants, prepared the site, raised a little money, and then dug her first hole. One year later, Ella had created a thriving native plant garden, complete with signs identifying the plants their butterfly visitors. More than that, sheâ€™d recruited fellow students to help care for the garden so when Ella moved on to high school â€“ where she started a new native plant garden â€“ her original project was left in good hands. All along, Ella got advice and inspiration from Theodore Payne Foundation staff. We were more than proud to sponsor her attendance at a native plant conference. Today, Ella is applying to colleges for a biology degree so she can continue to steward nature through her career.","City of Butterflies will allow LAâ€™s BEST and TPF to build on their past collaboration on native plant gardening projects.

We uphold this through playwork, making play spaces with open-ended play parts, outreach, and workshops","One challenge we anticipate is getting local communities aware of, and invested in the program. To get ahead of this, we plan on having lots of face time in the park, flyers and advertising for the program at local schools and after-school programs. Likewise, we are holding longer residencies to build trust and familiarity with what the program is trying to accomplish. 
 
 
 
 In addition, we will be including and investing time in the park staff of our chosen sites during our reflection times and workshops, and hope to leave the door open for further involvement and advisement to parks. One of our goals is to equip the local parents and park staff (who know their community best) with anything they need to grow more spaces and opportunities for self-directed play.","LA County Parks and Recreation already offer endless opportunities for youth and families. What we love about adventure play and playwork, and what sets it apart from other programs, is its ability to accommodate any age, ability, space, group size, and community. Also how it shifts common dynamics of adult led activities, supports social/emotional growth and gets kids out in nature in their own community to tap into their own creativity and critical thinking!
 
 
 
 Considering our play materials, many of the loose parts used for pop-up adventure playgrounds like boxes, tape, fabric, string, containers, etc. cost little to nothing, are relatively easy to source, can often be reused over and over and offer endless possibilities! This factor allows families to easily incorporate loose parts play in their home impacting a childâ€™s everyday play opportunities as well as anyone interested in creating self-directed play space.
 
 
 
 Playwork is also a unique aspect of what we do. Playwork has deep resources in play research from adventure playgrounds spanning decades. We are in communication with national and international adventure play organizations and agencies that also practice playwork in a variety of locations and formats. Its philosophies are based in social justice for children to create spaces in their own communities that are wholly theirs. This makes the playworkersâ€™ role in the space incredibly introspective and thoughtful. Because our staff are versed in playwork philosophies and methods, many dynamics found at a typical youth activity that is adult structured are greatly shifted. 
 
 
 
 One of the cornerstones to playwork is creating a play space where youth are free to explore without an adult designed structure. Children can work with other children or on their own. The playworkers are able to support social and emotional space for the children through moderating communication difficulties, modeling giving and receiving consent, and working with the children to safely take appropriate risks both physically and socially. Children build resilience to obstacles at our adventure playgrounds especially with repeat visits. Our spaces also give youth the opportunity to play with others that are older, younger, and the same age. 
 
 
 
 By offering community workshops in play and playwork we are able to give adults in the community tools consider childrenâ€™s play and their role in making self-directed play accessible for them.","For us, success in this project is meeting these goals:
 
 1. Bring out more repeat visitors to the sites over the program window
 
 2. Inspire one or more of the sites we visit to continue the program or start a similar one.
 
 3. Expose the immediate community and childcare workers to playwork philosophy and the importance of self-directed play for children.
 
 4. Introduce new visitors to spaces and programs run by LA County Parks and Rec.

 One story stands out as an example of how our organization has opened space for such a culture. We have a family who has a son we will call ""Jake"". When Jake started coming to our sessions, he had a great time exploring the space, being outside, and playing alongside the other children. 
 
 
 
 One day, Jake seemed to get irritated with the others, kicking dirt at them, poking, or occasionally even shoving. His mom decided to take him home early. There was a message waiting for us soon after, apologizing for his behavior and assuming he wasnâ€™t allowed back. Apparently, things like this had happened at other play spaces before. Jake is on the spectrum, and is processing his social interactions differently than some of his peers. We arranged a call with Jakeâ€™s mom to let her know that he was always welcome and we wanted him to come back. We also told her we would chat with our Houston friends at the Parish Adventure Playground dedicated to kids who are neurodiverse. They gave us great guidance on loose parts that could help Jake as he returned. 
 
 
 
 Shortly after, we had a playwork workshop and many of our parents attended including Jakeâ€™s mom. It was here where other parents, not knowing of our conversation, let Jakeâ€™s mom how much they loved Jake.
 
 
 
 That was a year ago and Jake has been a regular in our program. The solidarity between Jakeâ€™s mom and the other parents has grown as well. These are the huge cultural frames that we are aiming to move. Though Jake has great days and still struggles on others, he and his mom know the community supports them no matter what. We want to encourage more children and their families to allow themselves to learn from each other. Jake needs access to this play and to others as much as they need to play with children like him. As one of our other parents said about Jake, â€œThis child is a gift!â€","5th District Parks and Recreation Department will be pivotal to help us define which parks are in the most need for open-ended play opportunities and education of play methods.

Local refugee resettlement agencies secure affordable housing prior to the arrival of a family or individual. In many cases, these areas of Los Angeles do not have employment opportunities near their housing and either refugees will remain on government assistance or relocate to another state to find opportunities that meet their housing and income requirements. 
 
 
 
 Flavors from Afar addresses this issue of secondary migration outside of LA by bringing employment to the homes of these refugees. Chefs have the option of cooking from home or using a local commercial kitchen space without having to worry about long and costly commutes on public transportation. Transporting food across Los Angeles County is one of our greatest challenges as we try to bring food from our chefs to customer/donors across the region. 
 
 
 
 Our method to overcoming this challenge will be to setup cloud kitchens across the County of Los Angeles where our chefs will be able to cook food in different regions with high customer orders. Since many of our chefs do not have more than 1 car per family, we will rent kitchen space located close to their homes and hire additional refugee/asylee clients to assist with delivering food.

 Los Angeles Refugee Forum",https://www.tiyya.org/donate,https://www.tiyya.org/what-you-can-do,Flavors from Afar,LA is the best place to CREATE,"$100,000-$500,000",,,"Unique international cuisines are not always easy to find. Flavors from Afar is designed to help both Angelenos and refugees connect with one another through the culinary arts. Our current chefs are from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Syria, and Venezuela. We desire to foster a community that wishes to learn more about the refugee / asylee global crisis at a local level and give back in a meaningful way. 
 
 
 
 We plan to execute Flavors from Afar by using the following strategy:
 
 
 
 SELF SUFFICIENCY: Empowering our clients to view themselves as entrepreneurs and providing them with access to resources and opportunities to utilize their existing culinary skills. 
 
 
 
 CROSS CULTURAL EXCHANGE: Ensuring Angelenos have exposure to unique cultural foods through experiential dining. Our private gatherings include a 5 course dinner and storytelling by one of our featured Chefs. Guests are encouraged to ask questions about the refugee journey and learn more about the beauty of each recipe. Additionally, we provide delivery to those who want to try new flavors without leaving the comforts of their home or office. 
 
 
 
 JOB DEVELOPMENT: Although we currently have 7 chefs from 5 different countries, we know that by scaling our vision we can create paid positions that include, but not limited to; wait staff, delivery drivers, bussers, outreach coordinators, job training coaches, event planners, etc. By serving the Greater Los Angeles Region through catering, we ensure job opportunities are available to people across the county without being tied to a single storefront. 
 
 
 
 Refugees and Asylum Seekers are people who must flee their home country to preserve their lives and freedom. Upon arrival to LA, all of our clients are living below poverty level when enrolling with Tiyya. None of our participants exceed 30% of the Area Median Income. By developing their existing talents and encouraging entrepreneurship, it benefits LA both economically and morally. 
 
 
 
 In order to take our idea to prototype, we were accepted into a 3 month program with Grid 110. Flavors from Afar was piloted in 2018. After serving nearly 300 customers through our soft launch our next stage of development would be to secure a minimum of 10 chefs and 5 kitchen spaces in the Greater Los Angeles Region.
 
 
 
 Our intention is to make LA the best place to create a space for international cuisine that brings communities together. This new social connectedness around food will increase opportunities for employment and generate income for refugees starting a new life in the United States. Flavors from Afarâ€™s delivery and catering style is compatible to LAâ€™s goals because we provide opportunities for new immigrant entrepreneurs without the cost of real estate. Prioritizing the culinary arts via international cuisines provides our chefs with a creative opportunity to experiment with their dishes more freely and establish small businesses without taking high risk.",,,Active,CREATE,,,Voting Period,

Our platform ""Flowproject.la"" connects programs & projects to foster healthy civic environments with public art, urban gardens and water resiliency.","Bringing together various nonprofits to work on a common project has its challenges. Communications and managing partner expectations are common areas of conflict. To address these potential issues, the project will hire a professional facilitator to develop a clear implementation plan, including concrete deliverables and timelines.","There are a number of organizations tackling our project's issues individually (water resiliency, urban gardens, public art, disaster preparedness). However, we're not aware of a network working together to specifically pilot a scalable project, which provides disaster preparedness and resiliency technology and education to an underserved LA community.
 
 
 
 We're prioritizing the bringing together of cross-sector organizations to develop a relationship and align our work together on a pilot project that ultimately aims to solve the complex civic issue of community resiliency.","With the risks facing Los Angeles, earthquakes, flooding, landslides, forest fires and drought, to name a few, there is no question that a disaster will occur, it is simply a matter of when. Low-income families and communities often suffer disproportionately from these disasters.
 
 
 
 Resiliency is the capacity of households or communities to respond to and recover from adverse situations, including natural and human-caused disasters. Many communities, including those in South Los Angeles, lack adequate resources to invest in their resiliency.
 
 
 
 Los Angeles has recognized this need to invest in our cityâ€™s resiliency, and the needs of the disparate communities around LA, in its Resiliency and Sustainability Plans. One of the goals prioritized is to create neighborhood resilience hubs â€œthat facilitate social and climate resilience along with disaster preparedness and recoveryâ€.
 
 
 
 Our proposal, ""Resiliency IN A BOX"", will provide basic resources of water and energy to Watts and the neighboring communities in the aftermath of a disaster. The WEDEW technology can produce 300+ gallons of water a day, which can be stored for future use. The machine runs off-grid, using biomass, so it can continue functioning even if the city loses power. In addition to powering the water element of the machine, the WEDEW produces an additional 25kWh of energy that can be used. This technology is already being used by the State of California to support areas in Malibu still recovering from recent fire devastation.
 
 
 
 It is a strategic choice to place our resiliency box at a public school, frequently designated as a place to gather in an emergency. The urban garden at Markham Middle School is within one block of a high school and elementary school, with a total of 7 schools within a 1 mile diameter. Watts is only 2 miles wide though is one of the densest communities in our city. With so many people in such close proximity, this site is well positioned to serve as a resiliency hub for the neighborhood during times of disaster. 
 
 
 
 Our box is also a tool to educate the community about resilience and disaster preparedness. During the assembly process at their facility, AltaSea will host an educational open house for the community. Community Healing Gardens will develop additional STEM education programs and activities around the WEDEW for Markham Middle School students.
 
 
 
 Success for our project will be when a WEDEW is operating at the Community Healing Garden and providing community resiliency within a year.
 
 
 
 ""Resiliency IN A BOX"" impacts resiliency by providing off-the-grid vital resources with sustainable, abundant supplies of potable water and renewable energy. While assembling the box, the educational component of this project will be measured by event attendance. Weâ€™re expecting 400+event attendees.
 
 
 
 ""Resiliency IN A BOXâ€ supplies carbon sequestered biochar soil enhancement and water for urban gardens as well as opportunities for STEM education about access to healthy food. Enhancing the work of Community Healing Gardens will see success measured by more plants grown in the garden from the addition of the biochar, as well as additional STEM education activities for the 700 students served though their educational programming
 
 
 
 ""Resiliency IN A BOXâ€ provides pure, clean water for the students and their families offering a constant, renewable supply of potable water and renewable energy to the neighborhood both on a daily basis as well as in times of emergency. Atmospheric water generation (AWG) is a sustainable way to increase access to local water. 
 
 
 
 ""Resiliency IN A BOXâ€ will help successfully prepare the community to survive and thrive through disaster relief and resiliency education by providing a dense and underserved neighborhood with a resiliency machine that can supply 300+ gallons of water per day and 25kWh of clean renewable energy off the grid.","$100K =

 We have been inspired by projects like The High Line in NYC which repurposed an abandoned space into a vibrant urban park with community collaboration, public art & urban gardens, and is a great example of how a community revitalization program inspires its community, and beyond.
 
 
 
 We have also been inspired to focus on water and infrastructure as common ground issues, so our founder is on the board of civic scale public private partnerships like RiverLA and AltaSea at the Port of LA. 
 
 
 
 ""Resiliency IN A BOX"" was inspired as a potential catalyst to help our City develop neighborhood resiliency after studying LA's Resiliency and Sustainability Plans which prioritized creating neighborhood resiliency hubs â€œthat facilitate social and climate resilience along with disaster preparedness and recoveryâ€. 
 
 
 
 We were inspired when we learned of the Community Healing Gardensâ€™ work revitalizing an abandoned garden into a productive urban farm offering STEM Ed as well as a community safe space at LAUSD Edwin Markham Middle School in Watts. We drew on inspiration from the High Line and sought to enhance CHGs' work by including community resources, especially disaster preparedness, and public art. When we heard that students involved in the Community Healing Gardens' program worried about having adequate water for their plants, and rely on sometimes less than pure water from the schools' taps, we were inspired to help support them with â€œResiliency IN A BOXâ€.","Unycyn Civic Arts will administer the ""Resiliency IN A BOX"" project.

A communityâ€™s ability to respond to and recover from those disasters is the measure of its â€œresiliencyâ€. Low-income families and communities often suffer disproportionately from these disasters and lack adequate resources to invest in their own resiliency.
 
 
 
 â€œResiliency IN A BOXâ€ is a 20' long repurposed shipping container painted with water themed murals. This box will provide vital resources of water and energy to the Watts community on a daily basis, and in times of disaster. Called a â€œWEDEWâ€ (Wood To Energy Deployable Emergency Water, which recently won the Water Abundance XPRIZE), this machine dehydrates biomass (wood chips, green waste, etc.) to produce 25kWh of clean, renewable energy, 300+ gallons of water a day, biochar (a soil amendment), and it absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere so it's carbon negative.
 
  
 
 â€œResiliency IN A BOXâ€ strategically places a WEDEW at Community Healing Gardens' (CHG) urban garden at LAUSD Markham Middle School in Watts. Within 1 mile of the gardens, there are 7 other schools and 3 housing projects, making it a strategic gathering space in an emergency. 
 
 
 
 Although Watts is only 2 miles wide, it's one of the densest communities in LA with an average of 17,346 people per square mile. In addition to the 36,815 residents of Watts, the surrounding neighborhoods of Green Meadows, Florence-Firestone, and Willowbrook add up to almost 200,000 people living near the site. Our location is well positioned to serve as a resiliency hub for these communities during a disaster.
 
 
 
 The CHGs' urban garden at MMS engages and serves 700 middle school students with STEM Ed. â€œResiliency IN A BOXâ€ would directly benefit these students, their families, and the community by the WEDEW providing access to a pure, renewable source of water for them and the gardens. Additionally, the plants in the gardens will be enhanced by the biochar to produce more food and healthier soil. 
 
  
 
 This project will be executed in 4 phases: planning, building, implementing and growing. 
 
 
 
 Skysource will assemble the WEDEW at AltaSea, at the Port of LA. In addition to providing warehouse space, AltaSea will facilitate an in-kind contribution of a repurposed shipping container and support community engagement efforts. 
 
 
 
 Skysource engineers will be responsible for all box assembly and functionality. 
 
  
 
 Our civic art partner, Beautify Earth, will handle the murals on the sides of the shipping container, also providing opportunities for community engagement and education.
 
  
 
 Our civic garden partner, Community Healing Gardens (CHG), will incorporate the WEDEW into their existing urban farming STEM education program focusing on renewable energy, water resiliency, and disaster preparedness and will be responsible for its maintenance.

 SUCCESS WILL BE STRONGLY TIED TO THE LA2050 METRICS, FOR BOTH LIVE AND CONNECT:
 
 
 
 - LIVE: Access to healthy food: According to the Healthy Neighborhood Market Network, 31% of people living in LA do not usually have access to affordable fresh fruits and vegetables. Farmers markets provide a measurable increase in access to fresh, nutritious food. According to the Farmers Market Coalition, 60% of farmers market shoppers in low-income neighborhoods reported that their market had better prices than the grocery store. In general, farmers markets bring fresh food to areas that need it the most. We will support the growth of these markets. Beyond just access, #LAgrows will provide the education and inspiration required to get more people buying, cooking, and consuming healthy food.
 
 
 
 - LIVE: Obesity: The vision of Rebel Labs is to eliminate obesity and type 2 diabetes. An understanding of nutrition, healthy cooking, and healthy eating can have a major impact on this metric. In addition, proximity to farmers markets is associated with lower body mass index.
 
 
 
 - LIVE: Walk/bike/transit scores: #LAgrows will encourage community members to walk or bike to their local farmers markets. Through Rebel360 content, like â€œRun Right with Carl Lewis,â€ we also will be able to give people tools to integrate running into their fitness routines.
 
 
 
 - LIVE: Homelessness: GrowGood, part of the #LAgrow team and a 2016 LA2050 grant applicant, continues to make an impact on homelessness, providing training, jobs, and inspiration to Salvation Army Bell Shelter residents.
 
 
 
 - LIVE: Self-sufficiency: Local farms and farmers markets can have a tremendous impact on self-sufficiency. Locally-owned retailers, like farmers markets, return 3X sales to the local economy compared to chain retailers. Growers selling locally create 13 full-time jobs per $1 million in revenues, compared to only three for those not selling locally. And 25% of vendors derive their sole source of income from farmers markets (Farmers Market Coalition).
 
 
 
 - CONNECT: Public/open streets gatherings: According to the Farmers Market Coalition, people who shop at farmers markets have 15-20 social interactions per visit, compared to 1-2 at a grocery store. In an era of social media and Uber Eats, farmers markets represent massive opportunities to bring people together in a healthy and engaging way. Our nutrition, fitness, and wellness programming will help to increase that interaction and engagement even more.
 
 
 
 - CONNECT: Participation in neighborhood councils: Neighborhoods and farmers markets go hand-in-hand. #LAgrows intends to collaborate with Neighborhood Councils to engage, grow, and even launch new farmers markets. However, we also see opportunities to help support the NCs themselves. Our in-market programs, events, and activations can help to promote the Neighborhood Councils and perhaps bring new volunteers to them. As role models for their communities, we can promote and share recipes created by community leaders as a starting point for our user-generated content campaigns. Links to participating markets can also feature local NC contacts and engagement opportunities.
 
 
 
 - CONNECT: Social media friends and connections: Our team organizations have built their communities through a blend of real-world and virtual networking. A core component of #LAgrows will be social media challenges to visit farmers markets, prepare healthy meals, and share them with their friends and connections. As this user-generated content grows, we see tremendous opportunities for the social network to grow and strengthen.","$25K: development of Spanish language nutrition course and materials

 Rebel Labs was founded in 2018 by Charles Haston & Dave Whelan. In 2017, Charles, a former athlete & Marine, had hit 297 pounds and was watching his grandmother pass away from diabetes. Not content with ineffective solutions on the market, he embarked on his own weight loss journey (down 75+ pounds so far) and raised capital to form the nutrition & fitness company that he & millions of others desperately needed. He teamed with Dave, who has spent years at the intersection of technology, health, and wellness. From nutritional products to wearables, genomics to consumer services, Dave has a passion for changing lives through fitness & nutrition.
 
 
 
 Within a few short years, Mark Anderson went from investment banker to farmer selling tomatoes at LA farmers markets. His view on healthy living was transformed and inspired by the impact markets had on the health of market goers. He will always remember the first time a customer asked how he was growing his tomatoes, which led to hearing about how shopping at the market made a huge impact on her health. Countless stories like this Mark heard over the years fueled his passion for promoting the power of real food, launching his own farmers markets, and telling his unique story via a TEDx talk: â€œHow I Fell in Love with a Tomato.â€
 
 
 
 GrowGood is a non-profit organization that runs a 1.5-acre ecologically integrated farm to produce nutritious organic food for the adjacent Bell Shelter for homeless men and women.

 5. Finally, we will develop & execute a public call to action & community engagement. This call to action will encourage community members to share their successes via their own social media, which can be aggregated on the #LAgrows website.
 
 
 
 While we believe everyone can benefit from this program, we are targeting neighborhoods that are food deserts or that may not already have farmers markets or that have markets that need additional support, and populations that may not have access to adequate nutrition information, education, and inspiration. It is for this reason that we will develop versions of our primary nutrition education for the Spanish-speaking population.
 
 
 
 #LAgrows will commence in mid-2019, pilot some of its larger efforts in August 2019 (in conjunction with NFMW), continue to roll out in the following months, and achieve scale in time for LAFMW in August 2020. This will include year-round activities, as well as an ongoing plan for annual LAFMW events.
 
 
 
 #LAgrows will have a significant impact on making LA a healthy place to LIVE:
 
 
 
 - Access to healthy food: Farmers markets provide a measurable increase in access to fresh, nutritious food. 60% of farmers market shoppers in low-income neighborhoods said their market had better prices than grocery stores. Beyond just access, #LAgrows will provide the education and inspiration required to get more people buying, cooking, and consuming healthy food.
 
 
 
 - Obesity: The vision of Rebel Labs is to eliminate obesity & type 2 diabetes. An understanding of nutrition, healthy cooking, and healthy eating can have a major impact on this metric.
 
 
 
 - Walk/bike/transit scores: #LAgrows will encourage community members to walk or bike to their local markets. Through Rebel360 content, like â€œRun Right with Carl Lewis,â€ we also will be able to give people tools to integrate running into their fitness routines.",,Active,LIVE,,,Voting Period,
3533869722,ManifestWorks,"ManifestWorks connects those impacted by foster care, homelessness and incarceration with transformative job opportunities and provides the life and professional skills for long-term success.","ManifestWorks was formed to address barriers to employment, and Hollywood became our focus because we saw a natural path to the living-wage jobs for those that have significant barriers (often including felony convictions) to employment. The proximity of entertainment-industry opportunity to the massive challenges raised by foster care, justice system and homeless problems-â€“problems in Los Angeles County that dwarf other jurisdictionsâ€“is a happy accident of geography, unique to our community. 
 
 
 
 Still, those we serve often have bigger needs than just good jobs with good salaries. We know our participants carry challengesâ€“and, frankly, traumaâ€“that make their professional path even more perilous than it is for others with connections, top university degrees, etc. We also know Hollywood jobs are not for everyone: they are mostly freelance and extremely competitive, so there is a natural attrition rate even among the best connected and trained. 
 
 Our struggle: how can we offer ManifestWorks to as many people as need it, and, more importantly, once we accept them into the program, how do we increase the chances they will benefit from the transformative program we offer. 
 
 
 
 Data shows that reincarceration is a real problem for the majority of those exiting the justice system, that livingâ€“wage employment is almost non-existent for those with criminal records, and more than half of all foster youth end up in jail within two years of turning 18. 
 
 From the first day we opened our doors in 2014, we have been in constant contact with those we serve, and used data to measure our effectiveness. Our curriculum is frequently being revised and improved based on feedback. While all alumni would recognize the ethos, professional rigor and supportive accountability from our core program, recent alumni from even a year ago find new tenants of ManifestWorks unrecognizable, reflecting our mission to serve a more diverse crew of participants in better ways. (We also strive to increase the percentage of women and opportunity youth in each cohort, offering additional scaffolding to increase success among groups that have struggled in the early years of the program). Our most recent change reflects our response to feedback collected over the years. In 2019, we added our fourth staff position, our Social Service Program Manager, hiring a clinical social worker with experience working with foster youth, those impacted by homelessness and men and women leaving prison after decades. Now, all participants and alumni have access to case management and referral resources we know provide completely new levels of scaffolding. In just a few months, we are seeing a big difference in the resources we can offerâ€“and, at least initially, in our outcomes. Our current class is our largest ever, and for the first time in our history, women are 30 percent of our cohort. 
 
 
 
 We have always relied significantly on Hollywood industry professionals to help guide participants with their careers. With our social services program manager, we know can offer resources to participants for all the other parts of life. And, in the coming months, we will augment this position with mid-career resources (advanced financial literacy, industry specific training, professional certifications) that keep our alumni close and keep our programming responsive as they advance professionally. It is our goal that ManifestWorks provides support through the duration of our alumni careers.","While workforce development focused on foster care youth, homeless or formerly incarcerated individuals has grown rapidly, our approachâ€“and our resultsâ€“are unique. We know: 
 
 - On average, participants enter ManifestWorks earning $285 per week. Upon completion, they earn $696 per week; this rises to $1,172 per week (an annualized salary of $60,944) one year after starting ManifestWorks.
 
 - Around 80 percent of those entering ManifestWorks receive at least one form of welfare or government assistance (Medicare, housing vouchers, etc.); this drops to 7% of participants one year after completing the program.
 
 - Around 29 percent of those entering ManifestWorks have full time employment. In the first year after completing the program, 93 percent of participants report being employed full- or part-time; this rises to 100 percent of participants after one year.
 
 - Furthermore, our focus on connecting justice-impacted individuals to living-wage jobs with upward career mobility is uniquely results-driven. That we partner with an industry that only exists in our community makes ours a one-of-a-kind Los Angeles story. 
 
 
 
 And while there are other organizations that promote diversity for entertainment-industry employment, ManifestWorksâ€™ mission is to provide opportunity for those who have lived their lives without it. 
 
 
 
 Finally, our focus is on more than just good jobs: ManifestWorks seeds sustainable upward career mobility. We are interested in opportunities that continue to pay dividends for our alumni: We watch our alumni grow their careersâ€“and wagesâ€“without the barriers that have limited their potential prior to engaging with us.","Although we also focus on well-being and building a sense of the future, our primary goal is to give participants the tools to earn wages that change lives, and we use the salaries of our applicants against those of our alumni to measure our success. Other benchmarks of our impact include the number of graduates from the program, their wages post-graduation, and their wage growth over time. After more than five years of classes, we are able to access increasing insights about how our alumni fare over time. We plan to continue measuring graduation rates and wages along with important milestones such as: 
 
 - Number of working days per year
 
 - Sustained upward mobility in one'sâ€™ career
 
 - Attaining union membership status
 
 - Personal savings
 
 - Debt reduction
 
 
 
 In Fall 2018, ManifestWorks hired a data consultant to design and implement ongoing tracking of current participants and alumni. We embarked on a data collection through online surveys of current and former ManifestWorks participants. All data were self-reported by participants in response to standardized survey questions on demographics, employment, financial stability, and overall well-being.
 
 
 
 The results of the first round of data collection have been staggering, some have been reported in response to question #11. We commit to being fully transparent and letting this data validate our mission and our model. Here are some additional highlights:
 
 - In the first year after completing the program, 93% of participants report being employed full- or part-time; this rises to 100% of participants after one or more years
 
 - 89% of participants who completed the program report maintaining or increasing their savings over the past 3 months (40% maintained savings while 49% increased savings)
 
 100% of participants who completed the program report feeling that they have something important to contribute to society (some or all of the time)
 
 
 
 One fact that canâ€™t be ignored is that in California, the recidivism rate is over 65% - a costly problem to our society, the people in it and their future earning potential. The recidivism rate for people who complete our program at ManifestWorks is close to zero. And at the same time, we seed significant possibilities for career growth and earned wages. And more than anything else, we provide a pathway for those impacted by foster care, incarceration and homelessness in Los Angeles to a fulfilling career and of realized potential for the first time in their lives.","Monthly totals:

  â€œWhen I started ManifestWorks, I was in a bad place. I was somewhere I never expected to be. I was living in a homeless shelter, and this was after I had been in the Air Force and was a veteran. I had lost hope. 
 
 
 
 Someone told me about ManifestWorks and said I should apply. I was really cynical, I didnâ€™t believe anything could come of it. I finally got it together to fill out an application, and I remember the interviews were hard and thinking it didnâ€™t go well. When I got in, I was surprised, but still doubtful. 
 
 
 
 And then I showed up and saw other people who were going through the same thing, and I started to come around. The big moment was when I heard that I didnâ€™t have to focus on my past, but could focus on my potential and my future. That really changed things. 
 
 
 
 It got me to return to my writing. And got me to enter the Academy Nicholl Fellowship. I got to feel proud that my script is in the top 50 screenplays, among thousands of submissions. 
 
 ManifestWorks helped me transition out of survival mode so I could start living and start thriving. 
 
 
 
 Today, I've signed with a manager who represents me, and I have a bunch of scripts I am getting ready to share with the world with my eye on directing my own work. It was a year ago that I was accepted into the program, and as I look back, all of this change couldnâ€™t have happened without ManifestWorks.""

Our vision is one of transformation: we believe that living-wage jobs, professional mentors and a community of mutually committed, job-ready adults has profound impacts on individuals, on families and on communities, especially those that have bourne disproportionate impacts rooted in the lack of opportunity and social mobility. Harnessing our ties in film, television, and new media production, partners in Hollywood join us to teach networking, effective communication, leadership, accountability and the basics of production, enough to help participants excel at their first jobâ€”while laying the foundation for success in their second. The hands-on, practical focus sparks enthusiasm and engagement, and although we'll teach our students about every facet of the film businessâ€”and more importantly, how to network like a proâ€”the life skills we impart will serve them no matter what career path they choose.
 
 
 
 More than 2/3 of our applicants have mental health or substance abuse diagnoses, less than half receive adequate medical care, virtually all have been exposed to violence while living in high-risk neighborhoods, and studies show that close to 60 percent of those leaving incarceration will return to jail. Chronic unemployment or underemployment impacts all of our applicants, their wagesâ€“if they existâ€“are unsustainable, and many of those we serve have never had a job. 
 
 
 
 ManifestWorks serves those impacted by incarceration (84%), homelessness (54%) and foster care (18%), with considerable overlap. Applicants come to us from transitional housing, homeless services organizations, youth homeless organizations, post-incarceration transition homes, corrections, parole and probation officers, and employment services organizations.
 
 
 
 Currently, ManifestWorks offers two cohorts of its 12-week curriculum a year, one in the Spring, and one in the Fall, and we anticipate adding a third cohort in 2020. In addition to the curriculum, we add a few weeks to screen and interview candidates and hold an orientation prior to beginning each session.
 
 
 
 Given our knowledge that living-wage employment, a positive community, and engaged mentors are the most concrete ways to change lives, reduce risky health behaviors and improve long-term outcomes following extensive system contact and homelessness, ManifestWorks offers a unique opportunity towards well-being and personal and professional self-actualization. Our outcomes are unmatched: Not only are they healthier, more self sustaining, more hopeful and earning more money in dynamic and upwardly mobile careers than ever before, but they provide for their families and impact their communities directly.

3610053708,LawMaker,"LawMaker is a free advocacy tool for Americans who donâ€™t have a lobbyist in their corner. We help people crowdsource new laws, build voter coalitions, & engage politicians to advocate for change.","Activation and engagement are our main goals, which means apathy and complacency will be our primary challenges. Though homelessness is a problem that impacts more and more people, most of Los Angeles is unengaged with the issue, leaving only extreme voices on either side. Civic disengagement and resentment largely spring from the feeling that stakeholders can do nothing to impact outcomes. 
 
 
 
 LawMaker will overcome this by partnering with six or more elected officials who are willing to sponsor this public discussion and come up with policies that their constituents will support. Elected officials in LA are eager for resident engagement and support on this issue, but havenâ€™t been given the proper venues, notices, and forums to earn it. LawMaker will partner with politicians who are each willing to commit to implementing at least one community-centric solution to help the homeless that takes into account the concerns and proposals of a broad range of constituents.","Because of the challenges to implement homeless services, most advocates seek support from politicians that bypasses stakeholder opposition. This strategy has proved unproductive and has only built resentment against the homeless.
 
 
 
 The City of LA convenes public hearings, but many feel these venues do not invite two-way dialogue. In March, each councilmember committed to 222 units of homeless housing, however, this housing will have to be put somewhere. Locating these projects is when grassroots resentment is most vocal.
 
 
 
 The United Wayâ€™s â€œEveryone Inâ€ campaign is the closest project to LawMakerâ€™s activation, but has yet to show the use of technology and open forums to allow stakeholders to propose ideas in a way that can actually sway policy.
 
 
 
 LawMaker will work with the City & the United Way to help Angelenos be heard by their government. By empowering residents to authentically connect & contribute to the discussion, LawMaker intends to build political will for real civic change.","The LA Times quantifies the adversaries to homelessness solutions as a â€œsmall but vocal and implacable group of opponents.â€ It is not uncommon for a vocal and extreme minority to sway politics when the moderate majority doesnâ€™t feel involved in the discussion or have easy avenues to participate. LawMaker aims to change this dynamic on the LA homelessness debate. 
 
 
 
 By providing a year of publicly posted community discussions, both online and offline, our activation will make it easier for Angelenos to weigh in on homeless issues that impact their neighborhoods. LawMaker will measure the success of this effort with two key metrics. 
 
 
 
 First, we will quantify how many people participate in the yearlong discussion. This will include how many people attend public meetings, propose solutions in person or online, comment or propose amendments, and upvote/downvote ideas on LawMaker. Each of these people will have participated in the civic discourse on solving homelessness in LA.
 
 
 
 Our next success metric will focus on the results of this public discussion. Civic action should result in civic change. The success of this activation should measure that change by the housing and services created as a result of this process. A year after this activation, LawMaker will gauge the success of our endeavor by how many units of housing and dollars of services are proposed by elected officials to address homelessness in the LA area.",SEE BUDGET HERE: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dUMucFk-f3Kk_JHIwsCwlHfSzI4aane1qq0cw2pGCS8/edit?usp=sharing,"LawMakerâ€™s projected budget estimates this activation will cost $118,000 (which includes a 5% overspend contingency).

Last year, one of our members did just that. Jamie Tijerina, a young research scientist, used LawMaker to propose an idea she felt could increase civic access for all LA residents. Jamie was interested in the decisions her government was making, but worked a 9-5 job and could never make it to City Hall to participate in hearings or speak to her elected officials. So she used LawMaker to propose this simple but important idea:
 
 
 
 â€œOne of the biggest ways to increase community involvement and transparency is to hold public meetings at times when the public is available to attend. This means that meetings should be scheduled and held at various times throughout the day, including times after 5pm.â€™â€™
 
 
 
 Her idea proved important to many LawMaker users, and earned amendments and substantial support. Elected officials took notice, and on January 16, Council President Wesson and Council Member Ryu introduced Jamieâ€™s policy as an official motion before the LA City Council (https://lawmaker.io/successes).
 
 
 
 Jamie emailed our team with a confessionâ€”she had no idea her policy could actually make it to her politicians, and she needed some guidance now that it had. We told Jamie she needed to become her own lobbyist, engage council members and civic groups, and advocate that they call for a vote.
 
 
 
 Jamie called for a meeting with Councilman Ryu and got a one-on-one sit-down. She was interviewed by the Neighborhood Council Budget Advocates and explained why she felt many Angelenos donâ€™t or canâ€™t participate in civic life. She advocated for her policy among neighborhood councils and civic groups, resulting in the City receiving 32 letters of support for her motion, including official community impact statements â€” engagement unheard of for previous â€œschedulingâ€ policies like hers.
 
 
 
 And two weeks ago, Jamie launched her campaign for District 14 of the LA City Council!
 
 
 
 Jamie had this power in her the entire time. But when our team sat down with her, she told us that seeing her ideas in an official policy motion proved to her that she could make a bigger impact than she had ever previously dreamed. This is exactly the impact LawMaker strives to make.","Our Leadership Board will consist of 6 elected officials, 6 homeless sector leaders, & 6 civic leaders, and will guide the yearlong discussion toward tangible policy resolutions & provide public feedback at regular intervals. Each elected official will commit to address one piece of legislation based on community input from the activation.
 
 
 
 Homeless Service Orgs: HSOs will help aggregate data and evidence-based analysis to inform each phase of the discussion. Successes/failures of past efforts will be presented to illuminate the public discussion. Last year, LawMaker initiated plans to partner with the United Wayâ€™s â€˜Everyone Inâ€™ Initiative to expand their participation and impact strategies with our technology and outreach strategies. Plans were put on hold due to LawMakerâ€™s lack of funding, but the synergistic missions and shared goals showed great potential. 
 
 
 
 We have also met with Tanya Tull, President of Partnering for Change, an LA-based homeless service organization, who advised on our activation plan and offered to be a member of our leadership board.

Over 57,000 people are without a home each night â€“ 5,000 are children, and 4,000 are senior citizens. There is public consensus that something must be done, but a plurality of us has yet to agree on solutions, so little progress has been made. With the passage of Prop. HHH and Measure H to fund homeless housing and services, LA has an opportunity. How do we build the political will for tangible policies that lift the homeless, and Los Angeles, out of this crisis? Political will is entirely rooted in unity, consensus, and collaboration â€“ in a word, connection. 
 
 
 
 LawMaker proposes building this connection with a 1-year public activation that brings LA residents, homelessness leaders, and elected officials together to answer one question: â€œWhat programs to help the homeless can you support in your neighborhood?â€ The public dialogue will focus on increasing awareness of key levers impacting homelessness and building support for tangible policies to help individuals and families off the streets. 
 
 
 
 LawMaker is an online platform, but not everyone has equal access to technology. To ensure broad participation, LawMaker will work with the Cityâ€™s neighborhood councils to hold public events in each of LAâ€™s city council districts. These meetings will be advertised well in advance, shared through LawMaker's partners and the NCs, and will be streamed/transcribed online at LawMaker.io. In collaboration with the City, LawMaker will publicize these neighborhood council events as a way to truly connect and constructively discuss issues around homelessness. 
 
 
 
 To guide this public conversation toward a productive and tangible resolution, LawMaker will convene a Leadership Board of six elected officials, six leaders from the homeless service sector, and six civic leaders. This board will guide the various phases of the conversation and provide feedback to stakeholders at regular intervals. For example, problems identified in Phase 1â€™s open call for problem statements, will then be segmented by the Board into distinct verticals to be addressed in Phase 2, for example: affordable housing, homelessness prevention, mental health services, drug rehabilitation services, veterans programs, and safe parking zones. The elected officials and other board members will also be responsible for consolidating community feedback into draft proposals to help the homeless with programs distributed across the city. See the budget for an outline of the phased process.
 
 
 
 The policies developed will be presented to LA residents for review and comment via public government meetings, neighborhood council meetings, and via the online voting/amendment platform at LawMaker.io.

Comparable programs are run by universities with large endowments who offer little to no financial assistance for students to attend, assuring that all of the tuition they receive goes back to the program itself and that most of the students who participate are likely able to afford full tuition and time off from employment. Our program has none of those luxuries, and our major struggle each year is meeting studentsâ€™ financial aid needs while also maintaining sustainable internal staffing and honoraria and travel for our speakers. 
 
  
 
 One strategy for overcoming this barrier is to collaborate with universities to create scholarship programs to support student tuition fees as well as living stipends for working students, or students who otherwise might not be able to take time off work or other obligations to attend a three-week intensive workshop. However, for students outside of the university system who canâ€™t access that support, we work to raise funds via alternative methods such as grants as well as individual donations. This method takes both the expertise and time of our staff to research, implement, and anticipate funding needs while also planning and executing the program itself. Despite the amount of work required, we are currently only able to employ Workshop staff year-round on a part-time basis, which we would also hope to rectify with the support of the LA2050 grant.","Summer programs, with the skills and networks they provide, have proven an effective tool for student advancement within an industry that otherwise relies heavily on unpaid internships and legacy connections. Such courses, however, charge high tuitions, offer little to no financial aid, encourage applicants to take out personal loans if necessary to attend, and focus almost exclusively on the New York publishing scene. By doing so, they bolster the high financial bar of entry for individuals looking to gain a foothold in publishing and tend to replicate the racial, social, economic, and geographic homogeneity of the industry at large. The standard-bearing Columbia Publishing Course, for example, is approximately 85% white. The persistent homogeneity of the publishing industryâ€”predominantly white (79%), heterosexual (88%), and non-disabled (92%), according to Lee and Lowâ€™s 2015 Diversity Baseline Surveyâ€”raises concerns not only about the industryâ€™s hiring practices but also about the experiences and stories it presents to an increasingly diverse public. 
 
 
 
 The LARB/USC Publishing Workshop, by contrast, is committed to admitting and supporting all qualified applicants regardless of their ability to pay and to highlighting the vibrant and innovative work of independent publishers and new media pioneers outside of the New York hub. It focuses its recruitment efforts on underrepresented students looking to start careers or ventures in publishing and supports them with tools, training, industry networks, scholarships, and ongoing professional development. Students of color comprised 50% of this past workshop, and 89% of the entire 2018 cohort received full or partial financial aid through LARB.","To gauge the impact of the grant and program on the literary community, we will track the job placement of our all of our alumni, as we have for the past two years, through faculty outreach, networking events, surveys, and our alumni newsletter. All 60 students we anticipate admitting in 2019 will be invited to participate in written or video exit surveys upon completion of the program. LARB will also evaluate program planning and efficacy overall through quarterly performance evaluations by LARB leadership of program staff; student, speaker, and faculty surveys assessing the program and personnel; and program review by an outside observer, our USC faculty liaison, David St. John. As of this year, the Publishing Workshop has hosted over 110 visiting speakers and panelists, trained 101 total students and provided the resources and support for eleven ongoing publishing projects founded, run and sustained by the students themselves. We plan to incubate 8-10 new projects in 2019, bringing our total output to roughly 20 new literary ventures, and will continue to keep track of and promote all successful publications that come out of the workshop.

This does not include the the volunteer labor of our Program Founder, Tom Lutz, and others, the contributions of LARB staff, and of our community partners such as USC, our site visit host Red Hen Press, and the creative design firm Agility, who is helping to organize the LITLIT Book Fair pro bono.","We will cover the additional costs through a combination of student tuition, scholarship partnerships, and additional grants. Of our roughly $180,000 in remaining program expenses, we anticipate receiving about $90,000 in student tuition, $40,000 in scholarship partnerships, and $50,000 in additional grants. The program is completely scalable: with fewer resources we simply will support fewer students.","['Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","Our Publishing Workshop is committed to recruiting and training underrepresented students looking to start careers in publishing. We increase access to an industry traditionally centered in New York City and built on unpaid internships, legacy connections, and workshops that offer little to no financial aid. By contrast, we work to ensure that all qualified participants can participate regardless of their finances. We concentrate especially on building the publishing industry here in LA.","['Central LA', 'County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"Our Publishing Workshop has made a difference in many lives, helped place its graduates at the Hill Nadell Agency, Les Figues Press, Red Hen Press, Prospect Park Books, and Amazon Books, and has helped found Podcast Review, Soap Ear, BookSwell (an LA literary calendar and community forum), Tint, The Los Angeles Press (a press for women), and a number of other journals and publishing houses. Outcaste Press is a publishing house we helped develop in 2017. Earlier this year founder Varsha Ayyar reflected, â€œI am a triple Dalit: a feminist in a highly misogynist country, an â€˜untouchableâ€™ in a deeply hierarchical society, and a Brown woman from the Global South,â€ and â€œLARB embraced me, my proposal, my dream.â€ With the help and encouragement of the LARB/USC Publishing Workshop, Varshaâ€™s dream of building the first anti-caste feminist press based out of India became fully realized as one of LARB Booksâ€™ very first imprints. Outcaste is the first international Dalit feminist press committed to promoting anti-caste principles worldwide and to bringing global attention to Dalit womenâ€™s writings. 
 
 
 
 We at LARB have likewise helped jump-start and sustain the careers of many hundreds of local writers and artists who have written for us and who we have featured in our pages. As an organization, LARB has grown from a tiny operation in our founderâ€™s basement and a simple ideaâ€”that the world needed to find a replacement for the dying newspaper-based book reviewâ€”to one of the handful most important reviews of books and culture today, with an audience in virtually every country in the world. We have received congratulatory messages and accolades from people as different as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Cameron Diaz, Alain Badiou, Tom Hanks, David Lynch, Lena Dunham, and professors at Yale and UC Berkeley law schools; organizations like the National Book Critics Circle, the Columbia Journalism Review, and the NEA; periodicals like Forbes, Chronicle of Higher Education, The New Yorker, New Republic, LA Times, NY Times, Slate, and others; and authors Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, James Ellroy, Ta-Nahisi Coates, Joyce Carol Oates, Pico Iyer, John Green, Juan Felipe Herrera, and many others.","LARB partners with the University of Southern California for the Publishing Workshop. USC hosts the workshop on their campus in Los Angeles, provides on-site support for the duration of the workshop, makes campus housing available, and provides two full fellowships. LARB also partners with other California schools including UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, UC Irvine, UCLA , and other universities, who all provide fellowships for students from their universities.
 
 
 
 In addition to the university partnerships, LARB partners with a variety of literary presses based in California for one day of panels, discussions, and presentations as well as a book fair. In 2018, the LARB/USC Publishing Workshop worked with local presses Red Hen, Tia Chucha, Doppelhouse Press, Hayhouse, Insert Blanc, Kaya Press, Les Figues, Otis Books, Phoneme Media, Prospect Park Books, Rare Bird Books, World Stage Press, and others to feature their work through panels and private book fair exhibition. One of the goals of the Workshop, aligned with LARBâ€™s goals more generally, is to amplify and celebrate the wonderful work that these local presses do, and that is why we have decided to turn the book fair into a free event open to the public this year.

(The Columbia Publishing Course, for example, was 85% white in 2016.) LARB celebrates West Coast publishing and awarded scholarships to 89% of our 2018 cohort, half of whom are people of color. Maintaining this commitment requires constant fundraising and outreach. LARB has worked primarily with local universities and foundations to create 16 full scholarships this year; we have unmet need for another 30.
 
 
 
 The Workshop features 50+ leaders in publishing from the LA Times, Jack Jones Literary Arts, Buzzfeed, Coffee House, UC Press, local presses, big New York houses, and academics studying digital culture, and more; a visit to a local press; and seminars in everything from designing books to building budgets. We will also host the inaugural Little Literary Book Fair, a one-day, public celebration of many exciting, diverse local presses, such as Kaya, Tia Chucha, Tsehai, and World Stage. We match our Incubator Fellows with industry mentors who guide the development of their proposed ventures. We have helped launch projects such as Tint, dedicated to ESL writers; BookSwell; and Outcaste Books, an Indian anti-caste feminist press.
 
 
 
 LARB works with alumni year-round, even as we prepare for a new cohort of fellows. 
 
 
 
 In the fall, we revise the curriculum and marketing materials; reach out to universities for recruitment and scholarships; and apply for grants. In the winter, our application portal, ads, and social media campaigns go live, and we visit local colleges. By April, we review applications, determine financial aid, and finalize enrollment, speakers, and the schedule. In July, we welcome 50-60 participants, most of whom are in their 20s and 30s, to our program. The majority are local, but we also welcome participants from all over the country and world.

However any project held in schools can face financial and other challenges. 
 
 
 
 - Teacher Supports: Many teachers do not have access to resources and supports that make it easier to streamline class time and integrate election-focused curriculum. With the assistance of LA 2050, LA Youth Civics in Action teachers will receive small resource grants and classroom visits from Action Civics CA staff to assist with implementation. 
 
 
 
 - Project Completion: Last year, 100% of the classrooms that started Action Civics CAâ€™s program saw their projects through to completion. However, due to time limitations, 100% completion rate can become difficult to attain. For this reason, curriculum is a series of small manageable steps, culminating in a public presentation, giving students a big motivation to complete their projects. 
 
 
 
 - Community Response: Not all elected representatives and community leaders can be responsive to students. Difficulties reaching adult allies can demotivate students and turn them away from civic engagement. In addition, exposing student work to the greater public opens it up to criticism. Our curriculum prepares students to persist in their pursuit of civic change and listen to opposing views, ultimately resulting in improved social emotional learning outcomes.","ProCon.org is the country's leading source for pro, con, and related research on controversial issues. A 501(c)(3) nonprofit nonpartisan public charity, ProCon.org uses professional researchers and rigorous editorial standards. Understanding issues using this structured methodology helps to improve academic performance, increase civic engagement, strengthen personal resiliency, bridge political divides, and stimulate critical thinking â€“ the #1 skill sought by employers and educators. The New York Times has called our election site ""The most comprehensive tool for researching the candidates' stance on issues.â€
 
 
 
 There are several organizations like the Constitutional Rights Foundation, Facing History and Ourselves, YVote, and the Youth Policy Institute that work to amplify youth voice both in and out of the classroom. Action Civics CA is unique in its hands-on support of teachers and students and dedicated time for the site visits and mentoring that ensure schools have the resources to effectively take on community issues. Action Civics CA is also dedicated to Youth Voice and Youth Choice, providing the opportunity and agency for young people to choose an issue to research and take a stand.","Success for the LA Youth Civics in Action program will be determined by the following measurable outcomes: 
 
 
 
 Expanding: ProCon.org will increase its reach into at least 250 LA schools (and at least 400,000 Angelenos) during the course of this initiative. In addition, these 2020 election resources will be available for every school in LA. Through the two projects and events described in this initiative, 2,000 LAUSD students will complete both a 2020 election Project Soapbox speech and Action Project by the end of the 2019-2020 school year. 
 
 
 
 Engaging: Action Civics CA program staff will provide 100 hours of in-classroom support and host two city-wide events for students to connect across neighborhoods and districts.
 
 
 
 Learning:LA Youth Civics in Action students will be able to analyze local systems of power and identify community decision-makers and strategies for mobilizing people around a community objective or concern, as documented by teachers and self-reported on student surveys.
 
 
 
 Connecting: LA Youth Civics in Action students will participate in civic community work during and after the program and have meaningful interactions with community, government, business, and civic leaders, as documented by teachers and self-reported on student surveys. 
 
 
 
 Growing: Student social emotional learning capabilities will improve in the form of public speaking, confidence, leadership skills, problem-solving, empathy, and feeling like they are part of a larger community, as documented by teachers and self-reported on student surveys. In addition, all participating students will have meaningful adult-youth relationships.

 This initiative is designed to help students learn about issues in the 2020 presidential election, then take local action on them. This effort is driven by their research, preparation and delivery of a public speech, and later, a group action project. 
 
 
 
 The initiative includes:
 
 
 
 Researching and deliberating the pros, cons, and background of an issue in the 2020 presidential election
 
 Building critical thinking skills and social emotional learning (SEL) 
 
 Exploring personal and community perspectives on national issues
 
 Preparing and delivering a speech in public
 
 Peer to peer learning and collaborating around an issue-based project, and 
 
 Taking action in their community and school

 The ProCon.org staff of professional researchers will conduct research on the candidatesâ€™ position on dozens of key issues, and provide pros, cons, and related research on these issues.
 
 
 
 Students will investigate the local angle to the issue of their choice, and use it in the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 2020 Election Project Soapbox Speech: During the Fall 2019 semester, students will use ProCon.org to research and deliver a 2-minute speech about a 2020 election issue. Students will then write and deliver their Project Soapbox speeches at a city-wide event in January 2020. 
 
 
 
 2020 Election Action Project: During the spring semester, students will organize into groups to choose one of the Soapbox speech issues for an Action Project in which they will:
 
 examine their community, starting with mapping neighborhood assets,
 
 research the issue locally, using root cause analysis and surveys of family, friends, and neighbors, set a goal for solving the issue and analyzing who has the power to make it happen, develop civic action strategies, and take concrete action to affect policy on this issue. 
 
 
 
 Students will present the outcomes of their Action Projects at the city-wide Action Civics Showcase. At this event, students network with other civically-engaged peers and with community leaders from across Los Angeles, with the end goal to effect meaningful change in their schools, neighborhoods, and the city.

3650649419,Justice for My Sister Collective,"The Justice for My Sister Collective is committed to diversifying the film industry by equipping the next generation of socially conscious filmmakers with skills training, mentorship, and job access.","As a small non-profit organization, it's a constant challenge to secure sufficient funding for our highly anticipated programming. Each member of our team is constantly stretched thin to maximize our skills--we're often simultaneously providing programming as we're fundraising for the very program that's proven itself desired in our community. This endless hustle to find the next partnership keeps the organization in a perpetual state of survival mode and impairs our ability to be truly innovative in our approach to service. To combat this, we have completely revitalized our funding strategies and are actively applying to grants, utilizing public support, and launching new service offerings to diversify income streams and bring in new students and clientele. By securing funds with support from LA2050, we can offer our Futurisms Lab which is desperately needed to diversify the film and television industry and expand the public conversation of the role of women and people of color in science fiction, fantasy and genre film as a whole. 
 
 
 
 Unlike other screenwriting labs, Futurisms is unique in that it both addresses a growing cultural shift in genre and the need for greater racial diversity. According to the Business Insider, the 2018 Netflix census revealed Sci-Fi/Fantasy as the number one genre on the streaming platform, surpassing comedy and action categories. As a result, over 29% of all new Netflix content being produced falls under the Sci-Fi and Fantasy genre. Despite this exponential growth, racial diversity within the genre (and the film industry at large) remains sorely lacking. In a 2014 study conducted by Lee and Low Books, only 8% of all protagonists in Sci-Fi and Fantasy films were people of color. A separate study conducted by Color of Change showed that a staggering 65% of writerâ€™s rooms featured no black writers during the 2016-2017 season. 
 
 
 
 This lack of racial diversity within the Sci-Fi genre erases the rich history of Afrofuturism. Popularly referred to as Black science fiction, Afrofuturism is defined as a movement in the arts that explores the intersections between the African diaspora and technology. Marvelâ€™s Black Panther and Janelle Monaeâ€™s album Dirty Computer are prime examples of this tradition, as well as literature by Octavia Butler and other greats. To better understand the genre of Afrofuturism, participants of Futurisms Lab will be assigned supplemental reading throughout Phase 1. By using this genre as a vehicle to teach screenwriting to young filmmakers, student interest and retention in the program will be incredibly strong. Providing culturally relevant curriculum is one intentional way to support emerging artists of color. As more Sci-Fi projects get funded, graduates will be armed with a specialized skillset and a professional writing sample that makes them competitive candidates for the abundant professional opportunities that lie ahead. 
 
 
 
 All in all, by building a robust social media campaign and enlisting the support of our instructors, guest speakers and mentors--as well as the actors and other guests at the stage readings and other strategic partners in the film industry--we will be able to build public support for our initiative once we are granted initial funds to launch the first installation of this program. Our hope is that once we have established high visibility impact with our first cohort, we will be able to obtain multi-year grants from foundations, studios and networks who recognize the value of our work and understand the need to invest in voices that have historically fallen outside the purview of Hollywood.","Justice for My Sister is unique in that we are a film education organization led completely by women of color who are survivors of sexual violence. Our lived experience informs the unique approach we take to programming and how we utilize filmâ€™s potential to incite healing and cultural change. 
 
 
 
 In addition to this, we have not found other programs that cater to both Black and Brown creatives early in their career and that specialize in teaching the fundamentals of the Afro-Futurism/Science Fiction genre. Unlike other screenwriting labs, BIPOC Screenwriting Futurisms Lab is innovative in that it addresses the growing cultural demand for science fiction and fantasy stories. 
 
 
 
 Our market research has identified two main types of film enrichment programs in our field. Many programs are geared towards mid-career, working professionals who are looking to scale up. Other organizations offer after school programs whose base is 14-18 year old adolescents. There is a troubling lack in programming tailored for 18-30 year old emerging artists looking to break into the industry, and we are addressing this gap through our current programming. Our core participants have graduated from high school or college and are hungry for mentorship, skills training, and job opportunities. Currently through our programming, we provide this overlooked population with the resources and connections needed to succeed to create media that is socially conscious and community-oriented.","Through Futurisms:
 
 
 
 - Ten sci-fi scripts from fellows will be conceptualized and completed, resulting in 50+ applications for network writing programs and high-profile writing labs. 
 
 
 
 - We hope to see that 30% greenlight the projects and go on to secure funding to produce their short film or TV pilot within 8 months of the close of the BIPOC Futurisms Lab. 
 
 
 
 - We anticipate that 50% of our participants will go on to obtain subsequent production, shadowing and training opportunities upon completion of our Lab by virtue of their mentors. 
 
 
 
 - We foresee that 50% of our participants will receive subsequent employment and/or referrals from our film professional mentors. Many TV staff writer positions are never posted publicly and are only solicited through agents or word of mouth, making mentorship crucial in increasing participantsâ€™ exposure to professional opportunities. 
 
 
 
 - Filmmakers will display improved comprehension of skills and increased confidence in screenwriting for both television and film, in the genres of drama, comedy and sci-fi. 
 
 
 
 - JFMS will host 5 public stage readings to highlight the work of our BIPOC Futurisms participants. We foresee attendance of 130 people at each of our events. 
 
 
 
 - Participants will network and cultivate both important professional relationships and a public profile with community members in the audience.
 
 
 
 We will measure the impact with a comprehensive evaluation plan, using the following collection methods:
 
 
 
 - Facilitate observational evaluations, to be administered by staff. 
 
 - Collect evaluations and testimonials from filmmakers during the Lab.
 
 - Track the number of fellows who secure funding with future professional connections made through our program. 
 
 - Host biannual networking sessions to ensure the mentorship aspect of the program will lead to long-lasting professional relationships that will span the length of our participants' careers. 
 
 - Circulate biannual surveys to filmmakers and other industry professionals to assess relationship longevity and what professional skills are in demand. 
 
 - Follow up surveys for fellows 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the program.
 
 - Create video recap of the BIPOC Futurisms Lab with interviews to demonstrate impact and elevate our participantsâ€™ profiles.","The total budget for the Black, Indigenous and People of Color Futurisms Screenwriting Lab is $100,003.

Initially founded in Guatemala in 2011 by survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence as a companion project to the documentary, the collective toured Latin America hosting screenings of the film and workshops centered on healthy relationships and violence prevention. From there, Bautista replicated grassroots efforts in Boyle Heights and throughout California with the leadership of volunteers who were inspired to take action upon watching the film. JFMS obtained nonprofit status in 2015 and expanded our programming to include media literacy training, film production, and career preparation. A hallmark of our work at JFMS is our collaboration with the community to tap into the power of art as a means to break the silence, inspire healing, and challenge victim-blaming and patriarchal violence. To date, our workshops have helped activate over 200 studentsâ€™ creative potential. 
 
 
 
 Testimonial from a Participant:
 
 My name is Cassie Rubio and I am a 2017 graduate of Justice for My Sisterâ€™s signature program, Nuevas Novelas. As a queer working class Latina, I internalized the mediaâ€™s lack of representation and felt there was no space for someone like me in the film industry. I lacked the self-confidence and formal training to pursue that career path and had all but given up until I found Justice for My Sister. Through their summer workshop, I gained video production skills, was connected to women of color mentors, and found a network of support in my classmates. Most importantly, I gained the self-confidence necessary to assert myself as an artist. At the end of the program, I was selected to write, direct, and produce my first short film. 
 
 
 
 That film â€œTienes Hambreâ€ was later awarded the Best Student Film at the prestigious Imagen Awards. Currently, I am in pre-production for my second short film which will be screened at Outfest, the largest LGBTQ film festival in the country. My success is deeply tied to JFMS and their belief in my talent. This organization truly invests in their students' professional and personal trajectory long after they graduate from their programs.","For beginning writers, creating a script can warrant a gamut of emotions like anxiety, fear, doubt, and frustration. To address this, we are teaming up with Critical Mass Dance Company (CMDC) who will provide a dance therapy component to encourage participants to temporarily get out of their heads and into their bodies. They can focus on cultivating joy, trusting their intuition, and building community amongst one another.

Past partners have included: the East LA Womenâ€™s Center, Latino Equality Alliance, and the Esperanza Immigration Project. We will also activate other film organizations and online publications to announce our online application of the Lab. 
 
 
 
 The BIPOC Futurisms Screenwriting Lab is composed of three vital components--skills-training, mentorship, and movement--which culminate in public stage readings of ten participantsâ€™ final sci-fi scripts. 
 
 
 
 Component 1: Skills-training
 
 Participants will meet twice a week for ten weeks to refine their stories and receive feedback from each other, as well as six (6) guest instructors and two lead instructors. Instruction will cover the various aspects of screenwriting, as well as explore Afrofuturism as a genre. 
 
 
 
 Component 2: Mentorship 
 
 Mentorship matches are tailored according to participantsâ€™ interests, to ensure dynamic and engaging bonds that can last long after our Lab concludes. Mentors function as â€œscript doctorsâ€ who will provide in-depth feedback on different drafts of participantsâ€™ scripts.
 
 
 
 Component 3: Movement 
 
 A trauma-informed dance component in the Lab will serve as a useful practice for participants to boost inspiration and build morale. Critical Mass Dance Company will facilitate this segment for the cohort to establish a practice of wellness and holistic care. 
 
 
 
 Phase 1 (September - December 2019)
 
 Over the course of 10 weeks, workshops will be held twice a week for participants to write an original 10 - 35 page sci-fi TV or short film script. This professional writing sample will be used to apply for network writing programs, to secure funding to produce their work, TV writing jobs, and freelance work. 
 
 
 
 Phase 2 (January - May 2020)
 
 After scripts are finalized, public stage readings will be hosted throughout the following neighborhoods: El Sereno, San Gabriel Valley, El Monte, Boyle Heights, and East Los Angeles. We will invite high-profile celebrity actors to read the scripts to an audience of community members, industry professionals and high school students (approx 130 at each event). This heightened visibility of participantsâ€™ work will provide them leverage in securing management/representation and identifying potential funders or future collaborators.
 
 
 
 Futurisms will create an enriching space for filmmakers of color to develop their craft and career trajectory. Our communities deserve dignified and nuanced media representation, especially in sci-fi and fantasy where sexist tropes are typical devices. We look forward to nurturing future screenwriters committed to uplifting our communities through their work.",,,Active,CREATE,,,Voting Period,

The global success of our first product, the Trash Tee, made from 100% Recycled Cotton, has inspired us to expand the program to include three additional textilesâ€”made in Los Angeles from fabric to finishâ€”from trash. Recycled, recyclable, biodegradableâ€”and as a business, scalable.","['Central LA', 'South LA', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"EVERYBODY.WORLD co-founders, Iris Alonzo and Carolina Crespo, have 30 years experience in the apparel manufacturing industry in Los Angeles. More than two decades of that was spent growing American Apparel, which at its peak employed 5,000 Angelenos and made one million cotton basics a week in the heart of downtown LA. Unfortunately, in 2015, the iconic factory closed and all several thousand highly skilled garment workers were left unemployed. This was detrimental to those individuals and their families, as well as the larger manufacturing community. 
 
 
 
 From that point on, Iris and Carolina committed to doing things that would support local apparel manufacturing, while also being acutely aware of fashion being the second most polluting industry on the planet, and in 2016, Iris and Carolina set out to create the worldâ€™s first 100% Recycled Cotton t-shirt utilizing post-industrial waste streams. 
 
 
 
 To find a solution, they had to start at the beginning of a t-shirtâ€™s journey, at the yarn source. On their first visit to one of the largest yarn factories in the United States to talk about their waste streams, Iris and Carolina had their â€œaha!â€ moment. The yarn factory disclosed that they were producing about 500,000 pounds of cotton waste a week. One t-shirt is about half a pound of yarn. The duo had previously built a brand that was producing 1 million t-shirts per week. The math worked, and they knew they had an innovative and scalable business model!
 
 
 
 Fast forward two and a half years, and EVERYBODY.WORLD is still the only company that has figured out how to make a 100% Recycled Cotton t-shirt.

Itâ€™s true that we have successfully cultivated an audience on the 1degree.org platform, which will play a very important role in our outreach strategy. We are always learning and refining our outreach strategies, but there is a risk we may not reach as many people as projected. In order to overcome this challenge, we plan to invest capacity in scalable marketing and outreach, which includes digital marketing tactics that directly target low-income and at-risk populations. We have seen success in previous digital marketing tactics and outreach, and are reaching low-income families where they are: on their smartphones and internet-enabled devices.","The 211 call center is one of the most well-known resource referral providers. Callers can speak to a 211 phone operator who relays basic information on how to find a resource. While some 211 providers have websites, they are often outdated or hard to use. Help usually stops at making a referral, there is little or no follow-up to ensure resource utilization or track outcomes. 
 
 
 
 Modern, scalable technology has left the era of call centers behind. Most people no longer call to book flights, order dinner, or get almost any service. Low-income families are already relying on the internet daily, why should social services force them back to a bygone era of inconvenience? One Degreeâ€™s technology meets people where they are and offers cheaper, more scalable social service delivery. While we believe there will remain a role for call centers, that is not currently meeting most Angelenos where they are.","We will measure success by how many L.A.

He grew up as an undocumented immigrant in a working-class family, and his parents held several low-wage jobs to make ends meet, while raising their three young children in Los Angeles. Like many immigrants, Rey and his family experienced the difficulty of navigating critical resources, such as health care, educational programs, and immigration services. They depended on friends and teachers to be connected to services. Despite great advances in technology, very little has changed in the past 20 years in the social service sector. The challenges Rey experienced still plague low-income families today, which is what led him to found One Degree seven years ago. Today, One Degree has helped more than half a million families - including families like Tierra's in Los Angeles.
 
 
 
 Tierra was a single mother who told us her story of how she discovered One Degree. She was living on Skid Row, struggling for months to find stable housing. She found it difficult to locate family-friendly resources, because most resources in her community were geared toward single individuals. She also sought help from a number of service providers, including a case manager at a shelter, and from county offices as well. 
 
 
 
 Then Tierra heard about the One Degree platform from a community nurse at Union Rescue Mission. Tierra signed up for the One Degree app - and she was able to easily find family-friendly resources, including summer and winter programs for her young children and housing resources.
 
 
 
 Today, she has secured stable housing for her family and is pursuing a career as a realtor. And, sheâ€™s become a champion for One Degree:

Families often use more than 12 different agencies a year in their quest to meet basic needs.
 
 
 
 We believe that poverty in L.A. County does not have to be a life sentence. We want to make it easier for more of L.A. Countyâ€™s low-income families to navigate the safety net of services to improve health, food security, wellness, and improve economic mobility.
 
 
 
 The One Degree platform makes the search for emergency food, shelter, or health services as easy as ordering a book on Amazon. Angelenos have agency, and everyone should be able to access the support they need to prosper and reach their full potential. Every resident in the Los Angeles region should have the economic means and cultural capital to lead active, healthy lives. 
 
 
 
 The platform at www.1degree.org and apps on iOS and Android connect low-income and at-risk families directly to more than 8,500 critical social services in L.A. County, including:
 
 
 
 Urgent needs (crisis hotlines to overnight shelters)
 
 Food (food pantries to nutrition education)
 
 Housing (affordable housing to deposit and rental assistance)
 
 Education (after school programs to life skills classes)
 
 Health (prenatal care to mental health care and counseling)
 
 Household (baby supplies to cash for utilities) 
 
 Employment (job training to resume help)
 
 
 
 Users can find, manage, save, and track the services they are using. One Degree shows people resources that they are eligible for and the next steps to utilize them. Users can add ratings and reviews, and share opportunities with friends or family by email and text. This resource is live and available in L.A. County, but we want to launch a full campaign to grow usage and reliance on this powerful tool to improve lives. 
 
 
 
 We've set an ambitious goal to reach 100,000 Angelenos by the end of 2020. We will executive a marketing initiative in partnership with LA2050 get the 1degree.org platform into the hands of thousands more families and individuals in LA County so they can access the support they need to prosper and reach their full potential.
 
 
 
 One Degreeâ€™s primary target population is technology-enabled, at-risk, young people (ages 18-34) and low-income families. More than 50% of people who use One Degree are currently homeless or have been homeless in the past.
 
 
 
 Our activation strategies include (but are not limited to):
 
 - Social media outreach including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, and other emerging platforms where our audience spends time
 
 - Highly scalable and targeted digital advertising
 
 - In-person trainings and tabling at community centers, neighborhood festivals, and other gatherings across L.A. County with help from our collaborators

3959830371,Community Veteran Justice Project,"CVJP helps military and veterans get alternative sentencing and diversion, by setting them up with mental health treatment for their underlying conditions and connecting them with essential services.","Implementing the VRC pilot project presents a set of new challenges for CVJP. This VRC pilot project will be key in connecting with our youngest generation of service members, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) veterans. This generation of veterans is arguably in need of the most help of any generation prior, due to their propensity to have served multiple tours in combat. However, this generation often does not seek out help, struggles connecting with services or gets easily frustrated with the slow bureaucratic nature of many service providers. This has resulted in many student veterans to silently suffer from multiple mental health issues (e.g., PTSD, depression, anxiety, TBI), and are commonly dealing with problems such as homelessness, substance abuse, and domestic violence. 
 
 
 
 This pilot project is how CVJP will meet the challenge of connecting with this crucial population. Connecting with the college VRC's is the best means to connect with this younger group of veterans. It is crucial that CVJP is able to intervene with vets as soon after their arrest as soon as possible, and having more physical locations to connect is key. It is the most pivotal time for them when they are stressed and need one-on-one support. We will have a student veteran trained CVJ worker in the college VRC where other veteran college students congregate and know to go for services and support. These CVJ workers can help them get the mental health treatment to get their criminal case dismissed, which in turn, helps them turn their whole life around. These student veterans will be able to stay in college, keep their housing and jobs with a clean record, and continue to use their GI & veteran benefits in order to stay on a trajectory to live well and thrive for generations to come, rather than spiral down without intervention. 
 
 
 
 Luckily, when veterans, and especially younger veterans, are put on a mental health treatment plan, it has been shown to have very positive effects (i.e., San Diego Veteran Treatment Court Statistics: http://cvltf.org/veterans-court-statistics.html). Our organization will be able to provide the lifeline that these veterans need when they are caught within the criminal justice system, and can finally connect them with the treatment and services they need. In addition, the younger generations of veterans are very active on social media. By directly providing support to this demographic, our goal is that they will be able to inform other members of their veteran community about CVJP services, use of the statutes, and actively promote getting mental health treatment. 
 
 
 
 Another challenge is that CVJP has not done an expansion like this before, and there may be unanticipated issues. First of all, each VRC site is unique and has a number of intangibles that CVJP must coordinate. These include: where the college is geographically located, the administration the college is under, who the Director of the VRC is, how well staffed the VRC is, what the funding is like for the VRC, and how well organized the VRC is. At some colleges, the VRCs are a high priority, while some do not put as much focus into them. Some VRCs are well established and have been around a long time, while some are just becoming implemented or are even in the process of being built. 
 
 
 
 CVJP has garnered the enthusiastic support of the Chair of the Region 7 Veterans Program Directors Consortium. The Chair holds meetings every couple of months and has a positive working relationship with every college VRC. They will act as our liaison and help implement and support CVJP into the Region 7 college VRCs. We will use the Chair's vast knowledge of the colleges, the systems, the 'lay of the land' to help us navigate all of our challenges with each VRC and this environment. 
 
 
 
 The Chair has connected us to the Director of a supporting entity of the consortium of community colleges who have created a prospectus MyVRC digital app. This app will be available for each VRC veteran student to use. We are in discussions about including CVJP on the MyVRC app. When CVJP attended a Region 7 meeting of the VRC's Directors to explore their interest in this pilot project and all were very enthusiastic to collaborate. The Directors see the great advantage to their veteran students and their VRC to be able to offer these additional services right at their centers at no real cost to them. 
 
 
 
 Our strategy is to continue to build these critical relationships and pave the way for a smooth means of implementing this pilot project with the guidance and expertise of the Chair of the Region 7 Veterans Program Directors Consortium. We are welcome to any and all input from the individual VRC Directors. We are hoping to move at a pace and with the means that allows CVJP to provide proper supervision and handle the increased caseload 
 
 There will also be coordination challenges. CVJP staff will need to coordinate with each VRC individually to set up the CVJ â€œofficeâ€ files, forms, locked file cabinet, resource notebook, policy manual, and site-specific procedures. We must also be able to navigate college schedules with spring break, finals, semester breaks, and the VRCâ€™s ability to retain work-study students with continuity. CVJP will also face the challenge surrounding the supervision of the work-study students remotely.
 
 
 
 This leads to another challenge that CVJP is already facing, getting sufficient paid staff to ensure that we will have the capacity to oversee the case follow-up on all our military veteran clientele that will request our services. We need staff to track all our cases from inception to completion, as well as to properly train all volunteer CVJP staff. The majority of our staff are veterans who have expressed a desire to help other veterans. They are mostly interns and volunteers, whose fluctuating work schedules change with their classes and other things in their lives (e.g. pregnancies, new jobs, car trouble). We train them to use standardized forms to do intakes with our clients, while the executive director, program manager, and more experienced staff do the more sophisticated follow-ups for each case. With the constantly increasing caseload, as well as the increasing of sites for the project at the VRCâ€™s, CVJP must hire more staff to implement and supervise the increase in CVJ workers, as well as obtain more funding for sustainability.
 
 
 
 To overcome these obstacles of increased caseloads that CVJP is facing, our organization is looking to hire a Staff Attorney to have on site. This attorney will allow CVJP to recruit law clerks as staff interns for the project, as well as help with supervising and training CVJP staff to do more of the sophisticated follow-up and case tracking. This increased staffing will allow CVJ workers to always have someone to call when working with clients if they have a question or need assistance. A Staff Attorney will also enable CVJP to confer with defense attorneys representing our clients and increase our organizationâ€™s presence at local conferences and presentations. This attorney can also help with seeking funds for the project to ensure the project and positions are sustainable.
 
 
 
 In addition to hiring an attorney for the staff, CVJP is also in the process of onboarding a Project Coordinator (PC) to help implement our VRC project. The PC will be in charge of meeting with the individual VRC Directors, setting up the system files, folders, locked file cabinets, and site-specific protocols. Also, the PC will take the lead on our development program, utilizing our newly purchased grant search engine to find and submitting grant proposals. This development program will look to ensure that CVJP soon becomes self-sustaining. and by bringing on a part-time PC to accomplish this, we hope for this position to pay for itself within the first few months. Both new positions (Staff Attorney and PC) will help with the challenge of fluctuating volunteers, ensuring that our work sites are covered by trained CVJ workers at all times. 
 
 
 
 By continuing to focus on increased capacity building through our development program, CVJP is looking to address these additional staffing shortcomings and caseload increases. CVJP was recently awarded a federal capacity building grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which will focus on the technical assistance and training aspect of our current challenges.","CVJP is seeking this grant to expand our organizationâ€™s unique paradigm-shifting model. Our organization is currently the sole entity that is designed to utilize this model to help anyone that has ever worn a military uniform (active duty military, reservist, National Guard, veterans of all discharge statuses) get one-on-one support (ideally, immediately upon arrest) for all criminal justice cases. Our staffâ€™s ability to destress our clients, inform them about the critical California veteran criminal statutes, help connect them to necessary mental health treatment, coordinate documentation for all their court appearances, and connect them with all the services they need, is a one of a kind service for this underserved population. 
 
 
 
 VA VJOâ€™s help veterans with honorable discharges within the court system, but not until they are further along in the court process (not upon arrest, when they are stressedâ€”vets may not go to court for 3+ months after their arrest). VJOâ€™s also do not help active military, reservist, National Guard, or veterans with the other five categories of discharge statuses. On the other hand, CVJP is able to serve anyone who has ever served in the military. The Los Angeles County DMH court linkage program works with clients after they are already in the court system, but not upon arrest, and has not been set up to connect them with all they need for the statutes or the services they needed. 
 
 
 
 CVJP is dedicated to helping all our clientele, and since our organizationâ€™s launch, CVJP has worked tirelessly to develop strong, working relationships with all existing service providers for our targeted population. Our organization works to help our clients qualify to utilize the California veteran statutes through one-on-one support from our volunteer veteran team. We utilize a holistic approach prioritizing collaboration and coordination across many systems and entities to ensure all veterans, whether they qualify for the statutes or not, can access the services they need for mental, physical, and spiritual wellbeing. CVJP provides referrals to pro-bono legal services and other veteran service organizations across LA County; including, entities and attorneys for citizenship, VA benefits, discharge upgrades, housing and more.
 
 
 
 In addition, CVJP is the vital force in connecting and coordinating many of the existing entities to help build a more effective system to assist the military veteran population within the criminal justice system. CVJP is helping to establish the infrastructure throughout LA county in coordination with the Department of Health Services (DHS), Department of Mental Health (DMH), the Veterans Administration (VA), the Public Defenderâ€™s Office and other entities to create this coordinated system for all justice-involved veterans. 
 
 
 
 CVJP has given training and presentations to DMH court linkage program, as well as hosted meetings with multiple agencies: DMH, VA, Public Defenders, Director of County Diversion & Reentry. We have also given training to LASHA (Los Angeles County Housing Authority) and all their contractors to teach them about the statutes and help them become a resource for potential clients. We got LASHA to include NEW intake questions on coordinated entry system such as: ""Do you have any open criminal cases? ""Do you have any outstanding warrants?"" and CVJP will help them deal with those situations. Our organization also created and hosted a live webinar, providing training for judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and veteran advocates about the California veteran criminal statutes. We partnered with Continuing Education of the Bar (CEB), a leading legal education entity, to post the webinar at no cost as a public service, and were also able to provide Minimum Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) credits for the training. This training is posted on our website (www.cvjp.org) under resources or can be accessed here (https://ceb.com/pastcurrent-military-diversion-and-alternative-sentencing).
 
 
 
 We collaborate daily with VA Veteran Justice Outreach (VJO) workers, having them write letters for all the veterans that qualify for VA health care for their court appearances. Our organization has also worked closely with the Los Angeles County DMH, which has a court linkage program with social workers in the various courtrooms that can help with criminal cases that have clients with mental health issues, and who donâ€™t qualify for VA health care. We have established a strong working relationship with many public defenders as well, partnering on cases, sharing legal briefs, and helping their clients get the necessary services and documentation they need to use the military and mental health diversion statutes. The defense attorneys don't have the knowledge of what is needed by different sectors like reservists, or veterans with an other than honorable discharge. They don't know how to have a conversation with a military veteran client that says NO they don't have a mental health condition when they most likely do. A longer more in-depth conversation needs to take place about their sleep, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, the various traumas they experienced in the military. Nor do lawyers spend time lending support or provide comprehensive services.
 
 
 
 Finally, we refer cases, and collaborate directly with many services providers across Los Angeles County, including: Volunteers of America housing and services, US Vets housing, treatment and special womenâ€™s programs, Los Angeles County Military and Veteran Affairs, the UCLA legal clinic and Veteran Family Wellness Center, Higher Ground Recreational therapies, Region 7 College Vet Centers, the Los Angeles and Antelope Valley Veteran Collaboratives, as well as working with many interns from the USC MSW program and Pepperdine Law School and other colleges.
 
 
 
 Yes, some entities do some of what we do for certain populations, sometimes further along in the criminal justice system, but no other entity currently does what CVJP does as early as CVJP can (upon arrest) with the wide veteran population we work with (active military, reservists, National Guard, veterans of all discharge statuses). Nor do they do it as comprehensively as CVJP does.","At CVJP we define and measure success with a number of different metrics. First, we define success by the number of veteran cases we are able to take on, and how many staff we have on our team to assist these clients. In the upcoming year with this project, this metric will be measured with: how many college VRCs we are able to successfully implement the CVJ project at, the increase in number of cases from each VRC site, the increase in the number of clients who successfully obtain either diversion or alternative sentencing (showing how successful we are in helping our clients meet the California veteran statutes), the increase in total number of services we are able to connect our clients with, and the increase in CVJP staff that is able to be sufficiently trained to do more sophisticated follow up work on cases. 
 
 
 
 We will also be defining success based on the increase in CVJPâ€™s visibility, notoriety, and reputation. Primarily, this is because the more well-known CVJP becomes, the more well known the California veteran criminal statutes will become, and eventually the more veterans that will be helped. This metric will be measured with: the ability to attend/be invited to more events and presentations, the number of articles published either by CVJP staff or mentioning CVJP, news events focusing on CVJP projects, and all various means of media publication mentioning CVJP (e.g., social media, print, TV, radio). In addition, we would also measure this area to be successful, if there is a consistent increase in the number of testimonials from clients and defense attorneys that may be added to our organizationâ€™s website.","(Full-Time) Staff Attorney Salary - $63,000

Instead, the Veteran Treatment Court (VTC) model, which was very restrictive and did not help the vast majority of military veterans was being used. In LA, there were only five VTCs. CVJP was created to address this limitation, fill the gap, and inform that the statutes can turn any criminal courtroom into a VTC that serves this board population better. We are able to serve all military/veteran personnel intervening as soon as their initial arrest, seeking alternative sentencing/sealed records for felonies (PC 1170.9), diversion/case dismissal for misdemeanors (PC 1001.80), in all 24 courthouses across LA County & connecting them to vital services.
 
 
 
 Since our initial creation in October 2017, CVJP has amassed over 350 cases. Each of our clients is unique, but most share common themes, and they deal with similar hardships on a daily basis. For instance, Mark W., a Lt. Colonel in the US Army who was also an emergency room doctor, came to CVJP with a criminal charge and a suspended medical license. Mark had grown up in South Central LA and had pushed himself so hard to become a doctor and Lt. Colonel. However, Markâ€™s two deployments had left him with a severe case of PTSD, and upon knowledge of an upcoming third deployment, his anxiety and stress got the best of him. He ended up vandalizing his wifeâ€™s car in a fit of rage, ultimately being awarded an ""other than honorable"" (OTH) discharge, and got his medical license suspended. These events followed him for years and resulted in Mark living off of food stamps, and unable to practice medicine. No entity would help him.
 
 
 
 After CVJP was introduced to Markâ€™s case, our organization worked with him one-on-one, arranging for a discharge upgrade, and was able to get his medical license reinstated. Mark is now well on the road to getting his life back on track. He is getting the mental health support he needs and is active in his church and community. He is also working full time, in a healthy, loving relationship and has strong bonds with his children. Mark greatly appreciates all the work CVJP has done for him and is an active supporter to this day.","While CVJP works collaboratively with numerous agencies and nonprofit partners, we are submitting this proposal solely on behalf of our organization.",jodigalvin2@gmail.com,Jodi Galvin,818-633-2440,[],[],[],[],Non-profit organization,['No'],N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,https://www.facebook.com/CVJProject,@,@,https://www.cvjp.org,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPNFx-Q67s8,['Community Partners'],0-5 employees,No,,[],[],"['Rates of mental illness', 'Resilient communities', 'Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services']","['LA is the best place to LEARN', 'LA is the best place to CREATE', 'LA is the best place to PLAY', 'LA is the healthiest place to CONNECT']",Los Angeles,"1000 N.

In coordination with the VRCs, we will conduct a coordinated outreach campaign to ensure all their veterans students know about our services. 
 
 
 
 This capacity building and outreach effort will dramatically increase our organizationâ€™s caseload, and require us to hire a full-time Staff Attorney and part-time Project Coordinator (PC). Having a Staff Attorney will allow CVJP the ability to recruit law clerks, who can then help supervise the increased caseload. Our PC will coordinate the implementation of the VRC pilot project. Both staff members will help implement our Strategic Funding Plan, as well as our Development Growth Program to ensure that both the project and the positions will be sustainable.
 
 
 
 CVJP aims to serve all military members, past and present. This includes active-duty military, reservists, National Guard, and veterans of all discharge statuses. The VRC pilot project will be key in connecting with our youngest veterans (Iraq and Afghanistan), arguably those who need it most of all, due to their multiple tours of combat. Unfortunately, this population has extreme apprehension when it comes to admitting they may be suffering from mental illness. By informing these clients about the CA vet criminal statutesâ€™ mental health treatment requirement, we provide a catalyst that inspires them to finally seek the help they need, changing their life's trajectory.
 
 
 
 CVJP aims to begin training VRC work-study students by the end of April 2019. We are currently discussing with the Directors how to devise an implementation plan that will partner with the colleges on a semester by semester basis, working around student schedules. 
 
 
 
 CVJP is looking to make measurable progress by expanding our ability to intervene and provide one-on-one support with as many military and veteran clients as possible. The primary way that we will measure progress with this pilot project is by tracking the VRCs that are added to act as physical sites for CVJ workers. We can also track the added quantity of clients that are brought in by these VRCs. CVJP can track the added events, presentations, training & funds that each new staff member contributes, to get a measurable reading of how much our organizationâ€™s growth has been increased. Each of these measures allows more military veterans to get all the services they need, as well as help them achieve alternative sentencing, diversion, and dismissal of criminal cases.

3960545862,New Earth,"We provide arts, educational, and vocational programs for juvenile justice-involved youth to transform their lives, move toward positive, healthier life choices, and realize their full potential.","Our ongoing major challenges are the risks that come from many of the unhealthy communities where most of our students live. Role models, language, and expectations in their home communities can contribute to self-perceptions of themselves as criminals and victims and a short-term outlook on life. When they are on-site at the New Earth Arts and Leadership Center in Culver City, they are in a safe, gang-free environment surrounded by adults who care. However, when they return to their home communities every afternoon, there are often surrounded by the risks of crime, gangs, and toxic people. 
 
 
 
 We are employing several strategies to address this: 
 
 1. The New Earth Arts and Leadership Center in Culver City provides a safe place for students. Beginning in Fall 2020, the Center will transition to a seat-based model with a larger enrollment capacity, a stronger sense of community, and even more wraparound services. 
 
 2. LA County has partnered with New Earth to manage the transition of Camp David Gonzales in Malibu from a juvenile detention facility into a voluntary Residential Career Training Center. This program will provide system-involved young men with a 6-month program that includes housing, food, mental health support, vocational training, a strong sense of community, and job placement services. 
 
 3. This ""Caught You Doing Good"" campaign will provide strong incentives for our students to change their self-perception, strengthen their own resolve, resist unhealthy and unproductive choices, and strengthen New Earth's positive culture.","Many organizations work with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated youth. Many of these organizations bring a unique skill or approach, e.g. case management, arts education, vocational training, education. 
 
 
 
 New Earth is unique in several ways: 
 
 - Reach -- New Earth operates in all of LA County's juvenile halls and camps 
 
 - Comprehensive services -- New Earth provides a broad range of services including clinical case management, an independent study high school, arts programs, a social enterprise to provide paid job opportunities, and jobs placement
 
 - Transformation of the Juvenile Justice System -- The Residential Career Training Center in Calabasas represents a new model LA County is seeking to achieve as an alternative to incarceration and persistent recidivism. 
 
 
 
 As the nation's interest in alternatives to incarceration, New Earth's approach has received significant attention. New Earth was selected as a Nonprofit of the Year by the California Legislature in 2017. Founder Harry Grammer was selected as a 2017 CNN Hero and an inaugural Fellow of the Obama Foundation in 2018.","Success will be defined by the impact on the mindset and behavior of New Earth's students. We expect to see this in hard measures such as student attendance, peer referrals, task-orientation, completion of work assignments, participation in after-school activities, and so forth. We will ultimately measure success for this project as an accelerator of New Earth's culture and values.","The $100,000 will be allocated across both of New Earth's sites and will be administered over the course of one year in the form of gifts and cash donations to our youth in the range of $25-$500 based on individual and collective actions of ""Doing Good."" Staff committees at each site will manage the process to ensure that the cash awards are fair and contribute to healthy cultures at each work site.","Other costs for New Earth's programs are covered by many different government and philanthropic funding sources.

 Committees consisting of New Earth clinical workers, teachers, and program staff will meet regularly to ensure that ""Caught You Doing Good"" awards are distributed fairly and foster a positive culture. There will be two committees: one for the New Earth Arts and Leadership Center (NEALC) and another for the Residential Career Training Center in Calabasas. 
 
 
 
 Population
 
 New Earth serves formerly incarcerated youth, youth on probation, foster youth, and other in-risk youth. This population is almost exclusively low-income (nearly all qualify for free or reduced-price lunch) and nearly all are African-American and Latino. They are at high risk for entering or (reentering) the juvenile justice system annually. To date, 54% have been African American, 43% are Latino, 2% are Asian and 1% are White. 65% are male and 35% are female. New Earth youth come from communities characterized by high concentrations of poverty, violence, and gang activity. System-involved youth have complex social-emotional, academic and mental health-related needs, which our programs help to address. Most New Earth students arrive with some high school credits from one or several high schools as well as credits from LACOE schools. However, despite this, their levels of literacy and numeracy can be quite low.

 LA2050 Goals
 
 New Earth works with students who have dropped out of or been expelled from the traditional school system. New Earth helps students earn a high school diploma by providing a non-traditional academic environment, wraparound services, and love to enable our students to achieve their goals. New Earth will help LA2050 make measurable progress in several goal areas: 
 
 - Students' perceived sense of safety at and on the way to school 
 
 - Suspension and expulsion rates 
 
 - Youth unemployment and underemployment

Our goal is to accomplish the delivery of our programs within our $8M annual budget. Based on the latest audited financials ending 6/30/18, 84% is spent on program services, 15% on administrative and 1% on fundraising.
 
 
 
 Toward meeting this annual funding challenge, and developing the annual operating budget, both our Board and staff are instrumental in identifying cost saving operational measures, (last year we were able to implement $7,000 of such), as well as developing resources, ideas and connections to funding resources. Our fund development events are year-around and include numerous community groups and activities.","ONEgeneration provides a unique and broad combination of services and programs. â€œUniqueâ€ in that ONEgeneration introduced intergenerational engagement into our programs many years ago, and â€œbroadâ€ in that our programs and services connect to community resources that improve quality of life, health and well-being. 
 
 
 
 In response to an evolving community need, ONEgeneration Senior Enrichment Center is a complementary program that supports and plays a role in the implementation of the Los Angeles Purposeful Aging Initiative. The Purposeful Aging Los Angeles Initiative (PALA) is a groundbreaking initiative to connect county & city services, universities, non-profit and private sector services to help prepare Los Angeles for a dramatic shift in the older adult population. ONEgeneration supports and actively promotes recommendations that are intended to enhance the age friendliness of the Los Angeles region for all older adults and multi-generational residents as well as incorporating multi-ethnic services and strategies intended to empower marginalized communities with a goal to make Los Angeles the most age-friend community in the world. 
 
 The following recommendations developed by the PALA initiative are intended to enhance age-friendly communities throughout the Los Angeles region:
 
 1. Housing
 
 2. Social Participation
 
 3. Respect & Social Inclusion
 
 4. Civic Partnership & Employment
 
 5. Communication & Information
 
 6. Community Support & Health Services
 
 7. Outdoor Space & Buildings
 
 8. Transportation
 
 9. Emergency Preparedness & Resilience
 
  
 
 ONEgeneration is proud to play a role, support, and connect with similar programs and initiatives such as PALA, providing opportunities to connect older adults throughout the Los Angeles area.","ONEgeneration Senior Enrichment Center is dedicated to connecting 3500 older adults throughout the aging spectrum to the programs and services. Once connected, 85% of the members will engage in at least one program or service and experience increased feelings of social connectedness and decreased feelings of isolation & loneliness.
 
 
 
 Objectives
 
 1. During a 12 month period-ONEgeneration will engage and enroll 500 older adults in their Senior Enrichment Center. Through participation in the centerâ€™s many programs, these individuals will increase their social and relationship building skills, decrease feelings of social isolation and loneliness, take them to venues they wouldnâ€™t or couldnâ€™t easily get to, and they will feel empowered to continue to connect with the community. In addition, the centerâ€™s numerous social service resources will provide these participants the personal assistance and guidance they may need.
 
 2. During a 12 month period 100 individuals will engage in volunteering activities throughout the community to serve older adults, children, and at-risk youth. 
 
 3. Older adults attending the center will increase social skills on both a technological and in-person level through access to free Wi-fi and ongoing on-on-one intergenerational technology tutoring.","PROPOSAL ITEM #13 AND #14 DETAILED LINE-ITEM BUDGET

OSEC's primary focus is to provide an engaging environment by incorporating specialty services, 100+ weekly classes, access to health education & wellness services, volunteer & mentoring programs, and social activities for a growing aging population.",['San Fernando Valley'],Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"ONEgeneration is fortunate to hear stories of positive impact as a result of their services on a regular basis. Impactful moments are witnessed by staff, volunteers, and members attending ONEgeneration Senior Enrichment Center. The ability to provide individuals who are socially isolated, lonely and depressed the opportunity to connect to others and to the community, is what drives the services and programs of ONEgenerationâ€™s Senior Enrichment Center. 
 
 One particular story that stands out and truly defines the impact of OSEC services is the story of Ruth. Ruth first came to ONEgeneration after hearing about the program from a conversation she overheard at the doctorâ€™s office. Ruth is as a 72 year old widow who had been married for 48 years. After the death of her husband, Ruthâ€™s daily visitors became less frequent and she found herself going days without interacting with another human. Ruth was feeling depressed and hopeless.
 
 When Ruth first came into the center, she was hesitant as she didnâ€™t feel old enough to belong to a â€œSenior Centerâ€. But, as she was touring, she was instantly drawn to the vibrant music of the Zumba class and couldnâ€™t help but notice that the members dancing to Zumba appeared to be the same age as her. Ruth soon began to attend the Zumba class once a week, which turned into twice a week. She became good friends with some of her classmates who enjoyed going on travel trips organized by the center and decided to join them. As time went on, Ruth became a regular at the center and she felt the desire to do more. Ruth was a retired high school teacher and while at the center she learned about the intergenerational mentoring program for at-risk youth from one of the center volunteers who serves lunch and also takes the Zumba class. Ruth inquired about this program, signed up to volunteer for it, and then encouraged her Zumba friends to participate. Soon she and her friends became known as the â€œZumba crewâ€. In addition to taking an active role in reaching out to the community, engaging with people and connecting them to centerâ€™s many wonderful programs and opportunities, the crew members actively participate in the our small but meaningful at-risk-youth program.","ONEgeneration is the applicant and this is not a collaborative proposal.

OSEC developed a network of community partners at a single site where anyone has access to numerous services and activities. OSEC strategies and tools expand and sustain an environment where older adults can connect & thrive in their communities.
 
 1. Engaging community and stakeholders -OSEC engages with 50+ community stakeholders - neighborhood councils, universities, and health systems connecting them to services and supports they need to remain independent and active. 
 
 
 
 2. Creating Opportunities for Volunteerism- ONEgeneration incorporates volunteer services at the center as well in the field for anyone who wants connect with their community. Annually volunteers provide 20,000+ hours to OSEC programs.
 
 
 
 3. Innovative, Forward Thinking Development- OSEC develops opportunities that provide support and connections for older adults, families, and children in the SF Valley and LA areas. ONEgeneration is dedicated to change-based efforts that are responsive to community issues enhancing involvement and intergenerational connections. 
 
 
 
 4. Social Engagement Expansion- OSEC provides older adults the ability to connect on a systemic level, including increasing access to technology. Most OSEC members are low income and do not have home Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi and technology tutoring is available at OSEC. Funds from this grant will allow for expansion of Wi-Fi services and more technology tutoring at OSEC. 
 
 
 
 The LA 65+ adult population will double to 2.1 million by 2030. With this increasing number, social isolation and loneliness will be a health concern triggering the onset of dementia, heart disease and depression. Established in 1978, OSEC was staffed by volunteers providing recreation services to older adults. As the population of older adults increased, the need for innovative, adaptable services became a priority. Our focus includes building socially vibrant opportunities and intergenerational connections for low income older adults. OSEC recognizes a shifting population of older adults who maintain their independence longer seeking opportunities to stay connected. 
 
 
 
 Open 5 days a week, OSEC offers 100+ weekly activities, 250+ members visit the center daily and 3,200 are enrolled. Connecting older adults in the community, classes and services are also provided at libraries, affordable housing buildings, and clinics.

4001616980,Fulfillment Fund,Our mission is to make college a reality for students growing up in educationally and economically under-resourced communities.,"In our proactive approach to creating a college-going and educational success culture at our partner schools and across our community by hosting our Destination College+ event, we are most challenged by the difficulty of securing participation from students and parents. We have high reservation numbers but also high attrition rate for DC+. Due to the known obstacle, we invite a significantly higher number of potential attendees to compensate. However, there are risks involved with overextension and attrition, and our goal is to mitigate these planning risks by narrowing the attrition rate through a variety of strategies, listed below:
 
 
 
 1. Provide transportation to all event participants â€“ Funding for Destination College+ would allow us to provide round-trip bus transportation for students, parents and other family members. Transportation to a local college campus is often challenging for our families, who may have limited means of transportation. Familiarity with the area is also a mental hurdle, so providing transportation to and from a known location, such as their studentâ€™s school, would greatly increase our chances of the student and family actually attending.
 
 
 
 2. Provide onsite activities for younger children â€“ Families with younger children at home struggle with finding adequate child care while the older sibling attends with his/her parent(s). We plan to work with other local organizations and companies to provide fun and educational onsite activities so that younger children can also participate in the day and parents are not left with the difficulty of finding care.
 
 
 
 3. Engage school administrators and staff to secure student participation. We will explore ways to incentivize attendance from high school students. These include assigning participation as possible extra credit, having school staff be present at the event as volunteers, enlisting school staff to bridge communication with parents to ascertain participation, and enlisting school communication channels (newsletters, website, school text announcements) to bridge the gap in communication with students and their parents.
 
 
 
 4. Create a â€œdrawâ€ for parents and students â€“ Working with private industry partners in the entertainment space, we will seek to secure event participation from a performer, influencer or artist who is relevant to our participants, creating excitement around attendance. Our most highly attended Destination College event was one in which a well-known musician and actor served as the keynote speaker.
 
 
 
 5. Extend the invitation to participate to other local schools and organizations â€“ Over the last few years, we have explored partnerships with local charter schools to have their students attend and learn the vital information shared by our subject matter experts throughout the course of the day. There is a natural incentive, given that these schools are also trying to create a college-going culture; however, they often do not have the means to create such an event on their own. Partnerships have turned out to be a win-win for all, with local charters and private schools providing a means for their students to attend Destination College. With funding, we would have the latitude and resources to more broadly invite new schools to participate. We will seek to broaden our current partnerships by 20%.","Within Southern California, a few members of Southern California College Access Network (SoCal CAN) who provide similar programs, albeit within a different geographic focus. However, DC+ is the only event with a laser focus on helping low-income students who will be first among their families to attend and graduate from college. So that we contribute as leaders and collaborators to the larger conversation around college access and success, we share best practices and resources with this network regarding proven interventions and programs that can result from this event. 
 
 
 
 In addition to being pioneers in encouraging college access among underserved communities, we welcome every student regardless of their academic abilities and immigration status, not just the highest-performing ones. Our students come from all walks of life and backgrounds â€“ many live in supportive homes with a traditional nuclear family, but our student makeup includes those in single parent homes, foster youth, homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and at-risk youth. 
 
 
 
 We also recognize that not all students can immediately work on securing a bachelorâ€™s degree. Some may benefit from community colleges before transitioning into a four-year curriculum. To this end, we help students enter community colleges and foster their growth and transition to a four-year institution.
 
 
 
 In addition, we follow our students from 9th grade all the way to post-secondary graduation. From the core-college access curriculum, one-on-one mentorships to support student success, we provide information and resources to increase and encourage a college-going culture within the families of our students and among our full service partner high schools. For students who are in college, in addition to merit-based scholarships that ease the financial burden of a college education, we offer professional mentorship that helps facilitate the transition from college life into professional careers through practice interview sessions, professional introductions within the mentorâ€™s network and help with resume preparation. In other words, we help increase our studentsâ€™ chances of succeeding in their pursuit of a college degree and beyond.

 â€¢ Feria de EducaciÃ³n - In partnership with Univision Communications Inc., CSU campuses host Feria de EducaciÃ³n to assist primarily Spanish-speaking parents and their studentsâ€™ access resources and information to prepare for college success.

 â€¢ NACAC National College Fairs - Free and open to the public, NACAC fairs connect students to a large number of colleges and universities in one location. However, NACAC College Fairs are open to the public and attracts very large crowds. DC+ specifically caters to low-income and first-generation college-going students â€“ communities that are severely under-represented in post-secondary institutions. Due to our more targeted approach, students have more time asking questions while representatives from the different post-secondary institutions have more time to address each studentâ€™s unique inquiry.","As mentioned in the beginning of our application, we will consider the project a success based on a multiple different metrics in addition to the total number of students who will attend DC+. Below are our goals and metrics:
 
 
 
 â€¢ Increase attendance of DC+
 
 o from 600 to 1,000 high school students who will attend;
 
 o from 100 to 200 parents who will attend;
 
 o by adding 200 college students who will attend. 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Among Fulfillment Fund students
 
 o 96% of attendees will complete financial aid applications
 
 o 95% of attendees will commit to a college/university
 
 
 
 â€¢ Among non-Fulfillment Fund Students:
 
 o Increase their college going knowledge as measured through a pre/post questionnaire
 
 o Get a better understanding of the importance of post-secondary education

Jasmineâ€™s journey with the Fulfillment Fund began as a ninth grader. There, she met our team of passionate college counselors, including â€œMiss Elizabethâ€ who guided her as she prepared competitive applications, getting involved in extracurriculars, attending Destination College and scoping out her â€œdreamâ€ schools. Her journey culminated in walking across the stage of her high school with a 3.6 GPA and over a dozen college acceptances. 
 
 
 
 Jasmine was determined to get a college education but Destination College was the exclamation point to her post-secondary story. Shy by nature, she was intimidated by the sheer number of schools represented â€“ from small local public colleges to private institutions from the east coast. She worked the courage to ask the rep from UC Santa Barbara since it was her first school of choice. She was surprised of how welcoming the reps were and answered her questions. Jasmine also attended three different workshops offered at Destination College â€“ How to Seek Financial Aid, Paying Back Student Loans and Writing a Strong Personal Statement. By the end of the daylong event, she had two bags full of informational brochures from different schools and an intense conviction to attend college. She felt empowered.
 
 
 
 Jasmine proudly became a UC Santa Barbara Gaucho. In 2017, she became an intern at the Fulfillment Fund and volunteered at Destination College. In 2018, she participated in Fulfillment Fundâ€™s Career Expo and Career Accelerator, opening other internship opportunities. She spent last summer working with the Downtown Womenâ€™s Shelter. The experience led to consider pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in social work once she finishes her undergraduate education in sociology. She feels that this is the best avenue for her professionally and help the community at the same time.
 
 
 
 This June, Jasmine will walk across the stage in another cap and gown, donning her bachelorâ€™s degree and proudly claiming her place as her familyâ€™s first to graduate from college. Jasmine intends to remain involved with the Fulfillment Fund as a member of the Alumni Association and possible mentor â€“ completing the circle of support we offer.","Fulfillment Fund has a history of collaborating formally and informally with organizations to benefit our communities.

Indeed, it exemplifies the complex requirements necessary to gain college admission for todayâ€™s students. Students and their parents need to focus on SAT/ACT scores, personal statements, extracurricular activities, academic course loads, financial support, and importantly, visits to post-secondary institutions. Alone, each requirement requires tremendous resources. Resources that students from lower-income households do not have. 
 
 
 
 These college admissions pre-requisites result in low-income students (students who qualify for low cost/no-cost lunch) feeling that they have even less opportunity to get a college degree. Within LAUSD, only 70% of students attend college â€“ significantly lower than cohorts enrolled in private and parochial schools. Even worse, only 11% of low-income students graduate from college within 6 years. 
 
 
 
 What if there were a way to help low-income students be empowered and inspired to get a college education â€“ a one-stop shop that offers financial aid literacy, help with preparing and writing personal statements, advice on extracurricular activities and access to a multitude of post-secondary institutions? What if this day also helped students look toward their future career paths so that they could start envisioning themselves on that road to success?
 
 
 
 Destination College+ (DC+) is such a program. It is a daylong college preparation event that provides high school students, who may be the first in their family to apply for college, with a multi-faceted view of what to expect at college and how to prepare to get there. It addresses the unmet need of fostering a college-going mindset for low-income students. 
 
 
 
 This exciting, information-packed event includes college preparatory workshops, inspirational speakers, a campus tour, and an extensive college fair for 800 high school low-income students from Title I schools and parents. Some components include:
 
 â€¢ Grade-specific workshops that cover financial aid, career building, getting into your â€œright fitâ€ school, building a high school portfolio, personal statement preparation, etc.;
 
 â€¢ Parent workshops (in both English and Spanish) on supporting students through the college application process, tips about financial aid, and financial literacy primers;
 
 â€¢ College fair with reps from more than 75 universities and colleges;
 
 â€¢ Companies with employment and internship opportunities.
 
 
 
 Our timeline for the program is:

 â€œ...I found myself with the prospect of graduating [CSUDH] but without a clue of what my next steps would be. This is when I met Dr. Hamdan, my current Director and mentor. He encouraged me to become a math teacher, because I minored in math and because there was a shortage of individuals like me in the field. Some people have credited my success to my resilience but I know better. It is due to the educators that knew my story and didnâ€™t lower the bar for me, out of pity. Dr. Hamdan was able to see my potential, even before I could see it, rather than the broken young adult that others saw. Although my story is difficult to tell, today I write it in order to acknowledge the impact that the MISTI and TTT program, which Dr. Hamdan accepted me to, had on my success. The programs provided me with support and guidance and surrounded me with good people. This may not sound like a lot but for someone who is the first to attend college, it is the difference between making it or not making it to the finish line...
 
 
 
 ...After teaching for four year, I went back to school to obtain a Masters in Educational Leadership. Upon graduating, I reached out to Dr. Hamdan for assistance in securing a vice-principal position. To my surprise, he offered me a position on his team. Dr. Hamdan never lowered his expectations and always pushed me to be the best in all I did. It was his demand that I produced the best that prepared me for my current role. In my current role, my realm of influence is more than I could have ever imagined and more than anyone ever expected from me. So I end with a sincere thank you to Dr. Hamdan (and his team), and to other critical mentors, for believing in me and for having high expectations for me.â€","Our partner is the Los Angeles Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, a bipartisan membership organization that brings together leaders from the region's business, labor, academic and nonprofit communities to advance sound policy initiatives that responsibly grow the economy and create quality jobs throughout the LA region.

To really bring the practical application of science to life for students, teachers will also be trained in the use of advanced fabrication laboratory equipment for curriculum design and delivery. 
 
 
 
 LAUSD Local District South encompasses San Pedro, Lomita, Gardena, South LA, and South Central LA. We chose this district because of limited implementation and the largest achievement gaps in science among student groups are defined by race and income. LAUSD enrollment is 90% students of color and 80% are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Within Local District South, we will recruit teachers mainly from schools who have a ""STEAM Academy"" and/or ""STEAM Lab"". Additionally, we will guide schools that have a ""STEAM Lab"" on how to furnish the lab and make it operational to develop their own capacity to manage and operate the lab, engaging students in advanced fabrication technology. 
 
 
 
 The training will be rolled out on the following timeline:
 
 Months 1-2: Teacher Selection - CISE will consult superintendents and STEM/STEAM coordinators to identify which schools will most benefit from training. Principals at selected schools will recommend 2-3 teachers.
 
 Months 3-4: 4 Days of NGSS Classroom Training - Teachers will be trained on the conceptual and instructional shifts from the current standards. They will learn the three dimensions of NGSS, analyze lesson plans, and break down new performance expectations. 
 
 Months 5-8: Lesson Study Cycles â€“ Teachers will be grouped by grade level and work closely with an NGSS Expert to identify a focus based on student data and co-develop an NGSS aligned lesson. Teams of trainees will engage in collaborative planning-teaching-observation of learning, followed by lesson evaluation and refinement. Experts will lead a debrief to inform next steps and guide a second round of lesson study.
 
 Months 9-10: Fabrication Technology Certification - Teachers will be trained to use advanced fabrication equipment, such as 3D printers, Vinyl cutters, Laser Cutters, and CNC Routers, and to incorporate the engineering practices into their science lessons. With expert guidance, teachers will develop a unit of instruction that is NGSS aligned and demonstrates their ability to incorporate fabrication technology into their instruction.
 
 Months 1-12: Ongoing Evaluation and Revision 
 
 
 
 LA cannot be the best place to learn if our science teachers can't prepare students for college, careers and citizenship. Limited NGSS implementation is troubling in California where only 24% of 4th and 8th graders test proficient on the National Assessment of Education Progress in Science.

4309899861,Harlem Lacrosse - Los Angeles,"HL-LA empowers students who are most at risk for academic decline and dropout to rise above their challenges, reach their full potential, and dream about tomorrow while training on and off the field.","One of the biggest challenges that can make it difficult for participants to participate in Harlem Lacrosse programs is transportation. The geography of Los Angeles coupled with fewer public transportation options and LA's infamous traffic congestion can make it very difficult for working parents to provide regular, punctual transportation for their children during out-of-school-time hours.
 
 
 
 One way Harlem Lacrosse attempts to minimize this barrier is by hosting programs at the schools the students attend. Program Directors utilize the facilities that are available on school site campuses and also use nearby city parks for practices and games. While some students are older and savvier and are capable of navigating the city bus system, many are too young to travel on their own; for these players Program Directors activate parents to help out with carpools. When those options are not sufficient, Harlem Lacrosse rents buses to provide safe and reliable transportation for all participants to a location or event. 
 
 Enrichment trips, tournaments, college visits, and other important program events are critical to the mission and success of Harlem Lacrosse - Los Angeles, and these transportation costs are a large part of the program's budget each year.
 
 
 
 Another barrier is the issue of field space, and the availability of safe, well-lit fields that are suitable for lacrosse training. We work with our school partners and utilize every available resource on each site, which sometimes means modifying practice plans to play on blacktop or using tennis balls if practice space is shared with other groups. Harlem Lacrosse roots itself in the communities it serves, and seeks out local parks and fields to host Play Days, scrimmages and games. These â€œhome fieldsâ€ include Enterprise Park in Compton, Championâ€™s Field in Inglewood, as well as the school fields at Walton Middle School in Compton and â€œThe Academyâ€ field at the ICEF home office. These partnerships and access to city fields are critical to the success of the program, and competition for field permits as well as the rental costs can be a challenge for program design.","There are many groups that provide after-school athletics or academic support, and some (like After-School All-Stars) that have a similar sports-based youth development mission to ours. However, while these programs are doing great work and complementing services provided during the school day, only Harlem Lacrosse has full-time staff embedded in the school all day. This allows us to provide behavioral and emotional support, assist teachers in the classroom, and interface with Harlem Lacrosse students throughout the day, during lunch and other breaks while also providing high quality athletic instruction. This model allows for increased interaction between the Program Director and her participants, it fosters deeper and more meaningful relationships and allows for even more support as students navigate their middle school experience.
 
 
 
 This year, Harlem Lacrosse - Los Angeles is on track to offer over 300 hours of programming across all 12 months of the year. This consistency and breadth of programming is another key feature that distinguishes Harlem Lacrosse from other similar youth services organizations.","At Harlem Lacrosse - Los Angeles, we often talk in terms of leaps and breakthroughs. Sometimes it's a player who is reserved and quiet, who eventually gives a teammate a ""shoutout"" at the end of practice, or a nervous first-year player who scoops up a ground ball and rolls around a defender for a shot. 
 
  
 
 Whether it's a goal reached or a goal scored, we believe that all participants served by Harlem Lacrosse - Los Angeles will be changed by our program. They demonstrate greater resilience, self-control and ability to work with other people. They also learn the true meaning of commitment, improve their physical fitness and develop more healthy lifestyles. And ultimately, each participant will have a more future-focused view with the support of a Harlem Lacrosse staff member who works with each family to create a personal pathway to success. 
 
  
 
 HL-LA uses a few tools to evaluate our effectiveness as an organization. To evaluate the acquisition of non-cognitive skills, we use a tool called the HIA (High Impact Attribute) survey which was developed by our program partner, Up2Us Sports. 
 
  
 
 We also track academic performance as measured by grades in core classes and physical fitness as measured by the PACER test. Our fundamental objective is to see improvements in each area from the baseline in September to the end line in June.
 
  
 
 We also use a tool called the Most Significant Change (MSC) to evaluate the development of life skills. The MSC is a one-question oral survey which is issued at the end of the program year. We believe that higher rates of Intrapersonal Growth and Relationship growth responses are correlated to the development of non-cognitive skills. Based on our historical data, we have set a goal of 80% of total responses indicating either Intrapersonal Growth or Relationship Growth. 
 
  
 
 To evaluate the depth of participation we look at a few key metrics; hours of participation per year per participant, annual rates of attendance, and year over year retention. 
 
  
 
 Each year we compile an annual report detailing our impact. Some key findings from 2018 were: increase in GPA of almost an entire letter grade, 10% higher attendance, fewer suspensions, higher participation in Harlem Lacrosse programming, and impressive independent school and college acceptance rates.

Not only does he continue to train with HL-LA, he has grown into new roles, including serving as a volunteer coach, tutor, and member of our high school career mentorship cohort. Here is how he describes the impact of HL-LA in his own words:
 
  
 
 â€œWhen I joined Harlem Lacrosse - Los Angeles, my life changed. I grew up in El Salvador but when I got to the United States I knew no one and had no athletic options. I was new and timid and just learning English. I was introduced to lacrosse during a PE demonstration in 8th grade, and I immediately fell in love with the sport and the Harlem Lacrosse community. I really appreciated the mission, to provide opportunities to people, like me, who donâ€™t have much and who donâ€™t usually have the same access to sports like lacrosse. When I first started playing, I was shy and quiet, nervous to speak up or ask questions. The coaches at Harlem Lacrosse have challenged me physically and taught me valuable lessons about leadership and finding my voice. I have been a part of a career mentorship program for three years with the founder of AdvicePeriod, which included overcoming my fear of public speaking and giving a presentation to over 40 people. I have even started volunteering as a coach, passing on important lessons to the younger players. Now I have way more confidence and am a vocal leader of my Hamilton high school lacrosse team and am very involved in my school and community. Without Harlem Lacrosse, I would never have found my passion or become a high school athlete. Thanks to lacrosse I have been able to meet a lot of great people that have made a huge impact in my life, including players and coaches from club teams HL-LA found for me. The staff at Harlem Lacrosse encouraged me to chase my dream of attending Loyola, and have supported me through my decision to apply there this spring. Deciding to join Harlem Lacrosse was the best decision ever, it completely changed my life and helped me grow into the person I am today.â€","While we are not submitting a collaborative proposal, Harlem Lacrosse - Los Angeles relies heavily on the support of many important partner organizations. HL-LA has a wide network of partnerships, and the unique ability to bring this diverse set of partners together.

Historically a ""prep school"" sport reserved for more affluent families, lacrosse is mostly unknown in urban areas like South LA, Compton, and Inglewood; HL-LA is creating athletic opportunities for the students in these communities, teaching what it means to be on a team and compete as a student-athlete.
 
 In addition to traditional lacrosse activities like practices, games, tournaments, and camps and complemented by off-field events like local college visits and leadership training, HL-LA provides daily support by installing full-time Program Directors at school sites. A signature feature of Harlem Lacrosse, PDâ€™s are embedded in our partner schools, providing daily mentorship, leadership and enrichment activities, tutoring, as well as lacrosse instruction and competition. This sets us apart from other after-school service providers, since PDâ€™s are in school all day, working collaboratively with teachers, counselors, and school staff. These daily interactions lead to more customized support, family outreach, consistency in leadership and character development, and athletic achievement. HL-LAâ€™s intentional program design coupled with talented coaches and the sport itself, provide the perfect context to teach life lessons and provide trauma-informed coaching and mentorship. 
 
 HL-LA serves over 200 Los Angeles youth, ranging from 5th â€“ 10th grade across several school sites in South LA, Compton, and Inglewood. 100% of our student-athletes are either African American or Hispanic, and all qualify for free or reduced lunch. The program is offered to families at no cost; all coaching, facilities rentals, transportation, uniforms, and equipment are provided. 
 
 HL-LA is a year-round program designed to support student-athletes on and off the field, and participants average around 250 program hours per year. The fall season is nine weeks, and includes weekly practices, and Play Days on Saturdays. In the winter session, the focus shifts toward more specialized skill development and enrichment opportunities. Spring is lacrosse season, and participants practice, play games and scrimmages, watch local high school and college games and work with program partners to continue improving and learning how to compete. Summer season includes a week-long overnight lacrosse camp at the Thacher School and four weeks of â€œSummer Academyâ€ day camp. 
 
 Harlem Lacrosse is uniquely suited to provide both the stability and mindset our participants need in order to overcome the opportunity gap many face.

4320389013,The Institution for Art and Olfaction,"The Institute for Art and Olfaction is a 501(c)(3) non-profit devoted to advancing public, artistic and experimental engagement with scent through education, experimentation and advocacy.","Naturally, the connection between homelessness and the luxury industry product known as â€œperfumeâ€ is not a natural one. We anticipate some initial head-scratching. But we believe this is a meaningful project for several reasons. 
 
 
 
 This perfume garden can be considered an expansion of GrowGoodâ€™s (pre-existing garden) FARM- which is designed to engage positive and pleasurable use of senses, including the sense of smell, to support individual physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. In the garden itself, we will build shade structures, meditation areas, and simple spaces for a person to be at peace, and to be human. In this sense, the perfume garden can provide a sense of well-being. 
 
 
 
 Homelessness is a stigmatized status. Stereotypes about homelessness abound, not least of which is the negative stigma around what gets to the very core of our individual self-perceptions: their very physical presence in the world. In fact, smell is an argument often used to support the eviction of homeless men, women and children from public locations. While we would never say that this project is a way to combat those negative associations or evictions, the perfume garden is an opportunity for homeless individuals to interact with aroma in an empowering and creative way, to find a place to breathe, be calm, and - most importantly - to see the power aroma can bring to their human, creative selves by harvesting and processing meaningful plants to create beautiful scents, in a beautiful environment. All this juxtaposed against the everyday; the hot, industrial environment of Bell, California.
 
 
 
 If perfumery is an art, and if humans are creative animals, then it follows that humans have an inalienable right to learn about and create perfume. And history tells us that this is the case, across all social strata and cultures. From the Babylonians to the ancient Greeks, the Sub-Saharan tribes to the merchants along the Silk Road, humans have been trafficking in, creating, and enjoying scents from the dawn of recorded history. This endeavor is a continuation of that simple trajectory. This program will combat societyâ€™s basic implicit disapproval of people enjoying themselves, and their humanity, while homeless.","The IAO is the only organization of its kind in the United States, and - until fairly recently - the world. We have pioneered open source methodologies and access for the public good in an industry that is almost entirely behind the scenes. 
 
 
 
 GrowGood began more than a decade ago, with a few raised beds and the hope to provide some fresh produce to the Bell Shelter. Today nearly 10,000 pounds a year are wheeled across the street to the shelter kitchen. And GrowGood works in many ways to create community with staff, shelter clients and volunteers.
 
 
 
 This collaborative project would be the first project that we know of to provide resources and support for homeless men and women to create with aroma. In doing this, we aim to empower and humanize a forgotten population by creating access to materials, learning and creating through this most unlikely of pairings.","The measures of our success: 
 
 + Are we creating a comfortable, friendly, safe space for the homeless population at the shelter?
 
 + Are we creating learning opportunities and resources for the homeless population at the shelter?
 
 + Are we effectively providing a space where homeless people can engage with and learn about scent-making as a creative practice? 
 
 + Are we consistently providing empowering opportunities to create without our input or oversight?

We can break patterns, and break molds, here, in every field.
 
 
 
 Used for medicine and worship in ancient societies and considered a vital aspect of daily existence, for most of the 20th century perfumery has been perceived as a luxury product; something to be consumed by the elite. We launched The Institute for Art and Olfaction to help revisit and subvert the exclusionary narratives that dominate how we interact with a very vital (and very human) sense. Our aim, then, is to bring perfumery into the bigger world, and in so-doing to provide access to a new form of creative expression. This effort is fueled by the simple belief that - in the same way that people with no access to oil paint will never make a painting - people without access to the materials of perfumery will never engage in this vital creative practice. We empower people to learn a new medium with which to create by providing access and information. 
 
 
 
 In encouraging different groups of people to experiment with a heretofore inaccessible medium, we have facilitated new projects in fields as diverse as fine art, music, performance and more. Since 2012, weâ€™ve hosted over 6,500 people in our experimental laboratory in downtown LA, and with our institutional partners, weâ€™ve created public installations, workshops and creative possibilities on an international scale. 
 
 
 
 The Perfume Garden at GrowGood, feels like the most impactful next step we could engage in. By imagining and building a space to learn about, produce and enjoy aromatics in the public domain (plants), we hope to empower the adjacent homeless population to work with and enjoy aromatic materials. This will foster personal creativity in a very badly impacted population, allow connection with the natural world in an otherwise urban environment, and quietly celebrate the small joys that being human - and having a vital, sensitive body - can allow.","Both organisations are taking a leadership role in the partnership, within their areas of capacity. 
 
 
 
 The IAO will be leading the charge on an educational program of workshops, and management of the aromatics produced in the garden - including overseeing distillation efforts and more. Our team of scent educators, fragrance professionals and enthusiasts are skilled in leading workshops for the general public and creating perfume both from an artistic perspective and a technical know-how of the nuts and bolts.

4346064658,West Tenth,"We are building a digital marketplace that encourages women who have left the workforce to market (and monetize) their everyday talents to their neighbors, friends, and communities.","The high cost and high barriers imposed by securing business licenses or certification often paralyzes potential entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship is a risk, and many do not feel confident about investing in their idea or in themselves. California has been recognized as one of the most unfriendly states towards small businesses due to the significantly high barriers to entry for launching a business. 
 
 But unlike many of our competitors in the gig economy marketplace landscape, West Tenth will not make our entrepreneurs navigate this system alone. In fact, we intend to invest in high potential storefront owners. Helping them secure their business licenses and certification without imposing undue financial burden. To fund this we will run a grassroots campaign within LA communities. We will host events where all proceeds benefit aspiring storefront owners on our platform, and will keep track of the â€œbusiness license securedâ€ count on our website or social media.","We are similar to taskrabbit and Thumbtack in that we are gig economy marketplaces and help busy professionals accomplish tasks around the house. We are also similar to Etsy because we are a marketplace, and transactions are taken through our proprietary marketplace.
 
 
 
 Our uniqueness is our focus on creative and collaborative home and personal solutions, or as we call them crafted services. No other gig economy participant is focusing on this covert market as it largely exists by word-of-mouth referrals and is mainly women-led. Many of the businesses West Tenth will help launch would have previously been considered a knack or just personal talent around the house; however, we regard them as gaps in the existing, formal personal service landscape.","Success for our project will be based around how many women start businesses for the first time with the help our of digital marketplace, and how much revenue these women are able to generate for themselves.

One of the reasons we have structured West Tenth as a for-profit corporation is because there is a significant lack of venture capital funding for female-founded companies. In fact, in 2018 only 2% of all venture capital went to companies with female founders. We want to help change that number. As West Tenth becomes more profitable, we intend to provide capital to other female-founded startups; thus, creating a virtuous cycle.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","We would like support enhancing our tech products (mobile app and website) so we can scale our efforts and reach women in LA and beyond.
 
 
 
 We also need support around our marketing. We are trying to increase the value that women & society place on household and family management experience. We believe that the skills women gain while they are away from the workforce giving care to their families are inherently valuable and can be monetized.","['San Fernando Valley', 'County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)', 'Will start in San Fernando Valley & Conejo Valley but will expand to all of LA soon after']",Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"West Tenth was born over a cup of English tea just outside the library at the University of Oxford. It started as a conversation between two MBA students who also happened to be mothers (and much older than the general student population). Their conversation steered towards the incredible stay-at-home moms, and personal friends they knew who were just emerging from the intense years of parenting and ready to go back to work.
 
 
 
 Their friends, regardless of employment prior to motherhood, commonly felt lost and unwanted by the marketplace. As their friendsâ€™ time away from the workforce increased, their employment options seemingly evaporated. This outcome felt wrong, it felt incongruous. These women had gained real skills and maturity in their time away from work. They had invested their time raising human beings and volunteering in their local communities, why had this disqualified them from employment? Ironically, the MBA students felt they lacked many of the skills their stay-at-home friends boasted. Both students wanted to hire their friends to help improve their own homes and families. Inspiration struck.
 
 
 
 Why not encourage women to market their family and home management skills to their neighbors? Who wouldnâ€™t want an easy way to buy freshly baked bread from Tracy down the street? And what about Emily, the woman whose home looks like it walked out of the pages of Home & Garden? Couldnâ€™t she create the same kind of home for her aesthetically-challenged friends? These two students realized they knew countless women whose domestic skills were immediately monetizable, albeit undervalued and underrecognized by the traditional marketplace. As they began to speak about this to other students and friends who told them about more women in the same situation, they began to appreciate that this reality was pervasive. They began to see the true scope of the problem, but also the scale of the opportunity.

 West Tenth is rooted in an important observation: 28 million women are left out of the US workforce each year. Many of whom are mothers, caregivers, and neighbors with enormously valuable talents that are under-recognized, underutilized, and under-resourced. In building the West Tenth community we were struck by the number of creative, crafted services that are currently being provided for free by these talented women to friends and family. Many of these crafted services are not easily accessible in the traditional consumer-service market, and many of these women do not realize there is opportunity to monetize their talents.

4353562166,Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County,"The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (NHM) is dedicated to inspiring wonder, discovery, and responsibility for our natural and cultural worlds.","There is a common misconception that Los Angeles is overdeveloped and ecologically barren, when in reality it is home to one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world. Los Angeles is a designated â€œbiodiversity hotspot,â€ meaning that it has at least 1,500 species that are found nowhere else in the world, while more than 70 percent of the areaâ€™s original habitat has been lost to urbanization. NHMâ€™s researchers want to discover how nature is responding to the increased human pressure on our urban environment.
 
 There are powerful and interesting stories to tell about how nature continues to find ways to survive by adapting and transforming alongside us. These stories show how â€œwildâ€ and â€œurbanâ€ are more interconnected than most people assume. By exploring nature together and sharing our observations with the broadest possible audience, we help people see that nature is not a distant, exotic phenomenon only available to experts and naturalists, but it is all around usâ€”in our parks, hiking trails, backyards, and schoolyards. 
 
 
 
 From the San Gabriel Mountains to the Long Beach marina and alongside every freeway in between, LA is home to a variety of plants and animals about which we know surprisingly little. As human populations become increasingly concentrated in cities, urban biodiversity is quickly becoming a central part of ecological study. However, because most of LAâ€™s wildlife lives on private property, scientists are unable to collect data without the help of community scientists who share their observations. By using the ubiquity of smartphones to enhance our ability to gather crowdsourced data, we can turn the entire population of Los Angeles into urban nature researchers. 
 
 
 
 In partnership with The Nature Conservancy, we are using this data and our combined expertise to create a roadmap for creating a more sustainable natural infrastructure. Together, we launched â€œBiodiversity Analysis in Los Angelesâ€ (BAILA), a first-of-its kind map that showcases the surprising biodiversity of LA, even in its most developed neighborhoods. Our hope is for BAILA to become a guide for planners and decision-makers by highlighting how infrastructure development has the potential to bring nature back to the city.","NHM is a leader in researching and understanding the complex and ever-evolving relationship that lies at the intersection of nature, cities, and people. Working in collaboration with other complementary organizations, we are harnessing our globally renowned community science and urban nature research programs, our vast collections documenting how nature has changed as LA has grown, and the remarkable biodiversity of this metropolitan region to play a critical role in influencing the sustainable development of urban areas worldwide.
 
 
 
 While the practice of engaging volunteers from the public to assist scientists with their research is not unique to NHM, we are the first to organize a cadre of researchers to study a wide swath of species in parallel using local community scientists to amplify the breadth and depth of observations. We are also steadfastly committed to removing all barriers standing between members of our community and their connection to science and nature. One important step weâ€™ve taken to ensure the program provides an inclusive and welcoming environment for all Angelenos is to replace the term â€œcitizen science,â€ which had been in use nationwide, with â€œcommunity science.â€ Although ""citizen"" often means simply the resident of a place, it can also be defined as a person who is a legally recognized subject of a place. Because this latter definition may potentially discourage the participation of some members of our community, we believe it would be counterproductive and against the ethos of our work to risk excluding any person from collaborating on our projects or attending our events based on a misinterpretation of the programâ€™s name.","NHMâ€™s institutional knowledge about community science has grown over the last seven years as researchers and educators worked with partners and the public to refine the program. With feedback from our vast network of community scientists, we will continue to improve our strategies and empower participants with the understanding that they can make a difference in promoting urban habitats in which all life can thrive. Our success will be measured both qualitatively and qualitatively. 
 
  
 
 Qualitative measurements include the increased levels of connection that community science participants will feel to the richness of the natural world, the enhanced neighborhood pride, and feelings of acceptance and inclusion found in NHMâ€™s message that nature is everywhere and for everyone. With increased numbers of urban explorers mobilized throughout the city, our understanding of urban nature will grow exponentially. It is only through understanding that we can learn to better appreciate and protect it. The crowdsourced data that community scientists contribute enables city leaders and urban planners to make informed decisions about protecting LAâ€™s natural spaces and ensuring that every community has sustainable places for outdoor play.
 
  
 
 The quantitative impact of an LA2050 grant will be measured by tracking the numbers of community scientists enrolled, numbers of observations submitted through the iNaturalist app and tagged using #NatureinLA on social media, as well as program participation and attendance numbers both onsite at NHM and across LA County. This grant support will help make LA the best place to PLAY in the following ways:
 
  
 
 (1) Increasing the number and quality of informal spaces for play by expanding our Community Science network by 3,000; training 70 more teachers in how to use the iNaturalist app; providing professional development in community science for 350 more teachers to bring back to their classrooms and schoolyards. 
 
  
 
 (2) Increasing the number of parks with intergenerational play opportunities by hosting more bioblitzes in parks and communities across LA County reaching 300 more participants; and hosting additional Nature Days at County Libraries serving 500 additional family members. 
 
 
 
 (3) Increasing the number of residents with easy access to a â€œvibrantâ€ park by expanding community access to the Summer Nights in the Garden series to 4,000 more people, deepening engagement at Bug Fair for 1,000 people, and facilitating additional programming at Nature Fest for 1,000 people.
 
 
 
 In total, support from LA2050 would enable NHMâ€™s Community Science program to double its impact, connecting 10,000 more Angelenos to the nature in their neighborhoods. 
 
 
 
 In the near future, NHM will have even more effective ways for measuring the impacts of community science participation. Working with science practitioners and researchers from two natural history museums (NHMLA London and California Academy of Sciences), NHM is participating in LEARN CitSci, a 4-year, international research project which aims to better understand how youth learn science and develop Environmental Science Agency (ESA) through their participation in natural history museum citizen science programming. These findings will help science practitioners around the world design programs that can better educate, enable, and empower youth in science.","Proposed Community Science Budget

 At Leo Politi Elementary School, just two miles from downtown LA, we support Principal Brad Rumble in his efforts to connect students and their families with nature on campus. NHM staff visit the school to conduct wildlife surveys and to train teachers and students on how to use iNaturalist, camera traps, and insect collecting tools. Together, weâ€™ve written blog posts, tested community science kits for local libraries, and created a bilingual local pollinator guide. The Museum even showcases a student's stories about his neighborhood wildlife encounters permanently within our Nature Lab exhibit.
 
 
 
 At just twelve years old, Reece Bernstein became a published scientist when his observation skills and obsession with geckos led to an incredible discovery. Reece had become well acquainted with LAâ€™s reptiles and amphibians as he searched for them in the backyard, schoolyard, and on every family hike. So when Reece came upon a gecko that looked unlike any heâ€™d seen before, he uploaded a photo to NHMâ€™s Reptiles and Amphibians of Southern California (RASCals) project. Greg Pauly, NHMâ€™s Associate Curator of Herpetology, confirmed this was an important scientific discoveryâ€”the first time anyone had found an established population of the species in LAâ€”and worked with Reece and his dad to share the news with other scientists in a co-authored research paper. 
 
 
 
 Partnering with local non-profit, Heal the Bay, NHM hosted a bioblitz and cleanup event along Compton Creek. The event focused on finding, identifying, and documenting wildlife with a secondary goal of cleaning up the surrounding area. Over 60 participants and staff showed up to participate and removed over 470 lbs. of trash in the process.","While NHM is not submitting a collaborative proposal, our community science programs are based upon an interconnected network of individuals and organizations. Through our partnerships with libraries, parks, schools, community centers, and neighborhood organizations, we co-create programming that will best serve the needs of their constituents.
 
 
 
 Our partnership with the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation supports a six-week summer camp experience that incorporates Environmental Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (ESTEAM) to reach youth throughout the County. The Museum trains parks staff, develops curriculum related to urban nature, and provides oversight for the program. In 2019, the collaboration will serve 904 participants in 17 parks. 
 
 
 
 Collaborating with the Los Angeles County Library system, we are expanding the reach of scientific literacy and nature awareness to serve more communities within the region. These free family-friendly educational programs include â€œNature Days,â€ which offer a chance for children and adults to learn together through bug hunts, specimen displays, skits, and story time, and the new â€œNature Explorationâ€ kit lending program, which offers field guides, a nature journal, and specific tools that encourage outdoor exploration.

Through our network of community scientists, weâ€™re spearheading a movement to reclaim â€œnatureâ€ for all. Community science is a uniquely effective way for NHMâ€™s researchers, educators, and the general public to connect with each other using mobile app technology. The nature observations made by families, teachers, and students that are shared with NHM using the iNaturalist app provide our scientists with important wildlife data points from areas that are too vast and inaccessible to explore on their own. These hands-on learning experiences are inspiring thousands of Angelenos every year to connect to their neighborhoods with a new passion and perspective. 
 
 
 
 To ensure that people of all ages, backgrounds, and levels of science literacy can participate, NHM offers a wide variety of engagement strategies that respond to the needs of different communities. Designed and facilitated by a dedicated team of community science managers, these programs run continuously throughout the year.

This center will feature classes/workshops, access to mentors, prototyping equipment, and coworking space.","['South LA', 'City of Compton']",Lateral application (testing feasibility of a proven action/solution to a new issue or sector),"Our organization was born in 2014 when we learned that schools in Los Angeles did not have the experts available to provide industry-relevant computer science education. We saw a need to empower students to explore pathways to careers in S.T.E.A.M. and entrepreneurship in ways that their schools could not provide. We hypothesized that the best way to spark inspiration in a high school was to expose its students to their first hackathon, a 24-hour innovation sprint led by industry mentors who teach workshops and offer an environment for project-based learning. We recruited mentors from Microsoft, Moxtra, SpaceX, and more! With over 50 students attending their first hackathon and exclaiming they wanted ""more Hacker Fund, please,"" we decided that our greatest impact could be created when we partnered with the school administration, rather than circumventing or replacing the school system; thus, our Career Pathway Program was born! 
 
 
 
 By creating a framework that schools could adopt, we were able to inspire a student like Mariano Bonilla to pursue a career in engineering. We met Mariano when he was a Roosevelt High School student and we taught him to write his first lines of code at Code:Roosevelt, a hackathon for the Boyle Heights community that took place at the Salesian Boys and Girls Club. Last week, our founder bumped into Mariano at the LA Regional FIRST Robotics Competition, a competition in which students build a robot that competes in an engineering challenge. Mariano mentioned he is now studying computer science in college and actively returns to his Roosevelt High School to mentor more students so that they can follow in his footsteps: a pathway to college, employment, and a career in S.T.E.A.M. He plans to work for a technology company when he graduates and is also considering starting his own company as the technical cofounder. Our Career Pathway Program was built upon an Isaac Newton Quote: ""If I could have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulder of giants."" The purpose of our Compton Innovation Center is to provide the giants whose shoulders students like Mariano can stand on when they are looking to see what can lie ahead if they pursue a career in S.T.E.A.M. through Hacker Fund.",The Compton Unified School District (CUSD) will rent to Hacker Fund a venue at no charge for the purpose of building and operating the first innovation center in the City of Compton. This venue will be located at Centennial High School. The venue will have up-to-date internet networking and power capabilities.

We plan to bring this same type of creativity and excellence to Compton by building the Compton Innovation Center. 
 
 
 
 The Compton Unified School District (CUSD) serves 25,000+ students at 36 sites and is in the midst of a dramatic turnaround, marked by increases in student achievement rates, a graduation rate nearing 90%, dramatic facilities improvements, and a focus on S.T.E.A.M. (science, technology, engineering, technical arts, and math) throughout all schools. CUSD cannot achieve this type of turnaround without professionals who can provide the industry mentorship and access to state-of-the-art equipment. Our project provides this capacity-building support.
 
 
 
 The Compton Innovation Center will provide project-based learning opportunities for students of CUSD which will be curated by Hacker Fund staff. Students and local entrepreneurs who desire to apply their education to creating a prototype will receive capacity-building services including access to the coworking and maker labs, office hours with expert mentors, and fund development support. Entrepreneurs building nonprofit technologies will have access to fiscal sponsorship services and demo days.
 
 
 
 The new center will serve the 25,000+ students who attend CUSD and will provide them with a homebase from which they can develop their professional skills and their startup ideas. This center will empower Compton stakeholders to prototype technology projects, hire locally, and serve their city for years to come. By creating this center, Hacker Fund will help develop the local Compton economy and will ensure positive multi-generational change.
 
 
 
 From December 2018 through June 2019, we are procuring equipment donations and financial support for the development and operation of the innovation center. From April to July 2019, we will create industry-relevant educational curriculum, recruit staff members, and train personnel. In August 2019, we will complete our build-out of the center and will begin daily operation. 
 
 
 
 This project will make Los Angeles (LA) county the best place to LEARN by democratizing the access to resources for technology and entrepreneurship education. The Compton Innovation Center will bring cutting-edge knowledge and educational tools to a sector of LA County that historically has been under-developed.

4590919037,Building Skills Partnership,"BSP works to improve the quality of life for low-wage property service workers and their families by increasing their skills, access to education, and opportunities for career & community advancement.","Most workers are available to attend classes at various times for a few hours a week. As a result, participants at different skill levels are often mixed to accommodate scheduling. As a result, workers at higher skill levels in English require more challenging content, when it comes to nutrition vocabulary and other English-based lessons. Volunteer teaching aides are able to address this challenge as they are able to provide individualized one-on-one training to students. GJEP trainings are conducted in Spanish at the worksite to circumvent language barriers.","BSP exists because its members are not adequately served by existing service providers or other resources. BSP does not have direct competitors, but rather fills gaps in the existing service landscape. We often partner with providers offering similar services to better meet the needs of our members by leveraging collective resources. In fact, BSP's Health Program was originally developed in collaboration with Kaiser Permanente (which insures most of the workers BSP serves) after noticing low health insurance utilization due to a lack of knowledge navigating services.","BSPâ€™s programs are designed to improve the quality of life for low-wage, immigrant janitors and their families. BSP recognizes the importance of collecting qualitative and quantitative data as well as following up with participants in order to measure the success of its programs. BSP uses this data to evaluate program success and make improvements for future replication. Sign-in sheets filled out upon entry of each workshop track the number of participants who attend as well as basic demographic and contact information for each individual. Furthermore, surveys conducted before, during, and after trainings measure the effectiveness of the services in relation to participant satisfaction, they measure gains in personal benefits for participants and their families, and they provide the opportunity for participants to give feedback.","The following budget describes how BSP would use grant funding of $200,000 over 2 years to support our activities.
 
 - $90,820 for two Regional Coordinators (fully benefited positions) @ 50% of FTE, for program oversight and strategic partnership development
 
 - $57,420 for Health & Wellness and GJEP Instructors, for instruction delivery and coordination
 
 - $23,920 for training materials (including printing)
 
 - $20,000 for health fairs
 
 - $5,000 for travel to training sites
 
 - $2,840 for Health & Wellness promotional items such as freebies, giveaways, etc.","As an organization, BSPâ€™s diverse funding sources and fiscal health assure the sustainability of its work. BSP has achieved significant growth through its strategic partnerships and effective wrap-around service approach.

BSP uses a comprehensive approach to address janitorsâ€™ specific occupational health concerns and gives families the tools to create healthy lifestyles. At the same time, green workforce development trainings help janitors improve health by accessing better jobs and reduce the carbon footprint of LAâ€™s large commercial buildings.","['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"BSP was founded in 2007 by Executive Director Aida Cardenas, a daughter of property service workers who immigrated to California from Mexico. Our staff are all bilingual in English and Spanish, over 90% are Latino, and most are immigrants or children of immigrants. BSP began with its flagship Vocational ESL course and quickly expanded beyond workforce development to include comprehensive immigrant integration and community development initiatives. BSP now serves over 5,000 workers per year with education and training in vocational and general ESL, sustainable janitorial practices trainings, digital skills, health and wellness, citizenship, parent engagement, financial education, and other areas tailored to the diverse needs of our community. 
 
 
 
 An example of BSPâ€™s impact can be found in the story of Casilda De Jesus, who graduated from the GJEP program. De Jesus recalled coworkers sneaking Ajax to the worksite until they were discovered by supervisors. â€œHaving a better understanding of green concepts helps janitors buy into green practicesâ€, De Jesus said through an interpreter. The use of cleaning products that have a recognized environmental seal helps buildings receive points toward their LEED certification. De Jesus claims the switch to green cleaning detergents has alleviated her asthma symptoms. Furthermore, De Jesus and other janitors have brought what they learned home about composting, energy and water conservation. De Jesus now unplugs her TV, radio and other appliances when sheâ€™s not using them, recognizing that as, â€œenergy vampires,â€ they are still draining power. She urges her neighbors to report water leaks to their apartment manager.","Although this is not a collaborative proposal, BSP exemplifies a unique partnership between over 75 janitorial companies, more than 40 building owners, the Service Employees International Union-United Service Workers West (SEIU-USWW), and the broader community throughout California. In working with both labor and management, BSP has conveyed unlikely partners who agree that taking an interest in janitorsâ€™ health is in their best interest. When janitors are healthy, both labor and employers enjoy less turnover within the industry, lower rates in insurance premiums and a happy workforce. Similarly, a janitorial workforce trained in green cleaning practices helps workers meet skills standards that pave the road to upward career mobility in an increasingly energy-efficient commercial building sector.

 BSPâ€™s Green Janitor Education Program (GJEP) is implemented through collaboration with the U.S. Green Building Council and BOMA-LA, and addresses operations and maintenance practices that enable commercial office buildings meet green performance standards while defining skills, training, and upward career ladder opportunities for workers. The program covers energy efficiency, recycling, waste management, and water conservation.
 
  
 
 Among BSPâ€™s service population, 97% are Latin American immigrants, 70% lack basic English proficiency, less than 35% graduated high school, and with an average annual salary of $32,000, workers struggle to keep their families out of poverty. Additionally, 50% are over the age of 50, over 70% are women, and 63% of females are heads of household. Janitors have respiratory and dermatologic issues from exposure to cleaning agents, wet work, and rubber latex. They also suffer from musculoskeletal disorders resulting from awkward postures and prolonged standing, as well as mental health issues resulting from low potential for promotion, work isolation, and irregular/insufficient sleep schedules.
 
  
 
 Timeline: 
 
 Quarter 1: 
 
 -Conduct outreach for Health & Wellness and GJEP
 
 -Schedule training dates
 
 
 
 Quarters 2 to 7:
 
 -Conduct at least one Health & Wellness session and one GJEP session per quarter
 
 -Conduct pre/post evaluations to assess student knowledge gains
 
 -Continue outreach and scheduling activities
 
 
 
 Quarter 8
 
 -Conduct at least one Health & Wellness session and one GJEP session and final evaluations
 
 -Analyze evaluation data and report on outcomes to stakeholders
 
  
 
 As a result of the Health & Wellness program, janitors will have improved English language medical vocabulary, including healthcare terminology and nutrition labels. The will also have an improved ability to converse with medical practitioners. Janitors will learn how to stay healthy at work through eating healthy snacks and moderating caffeine and soft drink consumption; they will also have improved sleep schedules and reduced stress. Moreover, janitors will have improved access to online healthcare resources.
 
  
 
 A 2017 study found that 76% of GJEP buildings saw a decrease in energy and water usage, with GJEP buildings using 5.6% less energy on average. Furthermore, while standard cleaning products contain dangerous chemicals, green cleaning products keep janitors safer from respiratory and dermatological disease.

4738345311,Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation,The Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation (LADF) is the official team charity of the Los Angeles Dodgers.LADF works to significantly impact underserved youth in the most challenged neighborhoods of LA.,"A major challenge that LADF faces during this activation is keeping up with demand. Serving Los Angeles presents a challenge in itself due to the high volume of underserved communities within this location. Often, high poverty levels in Los Angeles contribute to the lack of youth participation in sports. LADF is attempting to bridge that gap by providing RBI and Dreamfields in underserved neighborhoods at no cost to youth and their families. At times, LADF can be stretched thin due to limited full-time staff and the large area of communities that are underserved however, we realize the importance of our work and the impact weâ€™re making in which we strive to continue creating equal access for all. 
 
 Although this challenge can present barriers, LADF aims to address this by developing and maintaining strategic partnerships between affiliate partners, corporate sponsors, local nonprofits organizations, LADF associates, corporate volunteers, community members and Dodger fans. Through these networks, LADF builds relationships necessary for our programs to thrive and reach as many as possible. Together, we can increase our reach and activate more Angelenos to engage in PLAY.","There are some great organizations conducting similar work in the LA community which include: Playworks, LAUSD/Beyond the Bell, Natasha Watley Foundation, MLB Youth Academy, and Club42. Of these, only a limited number focus on baseball programming in the community, choosing to support fewer formal forms of play. Of those who have baseball programs, do so on a smaller scale, selecting to focus on a certain age group, gender, or city to serve. 
 
 LADF believes in harnessing the Dodger brand to create the biggest impact possible. LADF differs from other organizations because throughout activation we engage LA county as a whole, nearly serving all seven service provider areas. In addition, we also provide comprehensive program resources that players and communities need to be successful in baseball/softball. For example, LADF partners with Up2UsSports to specifically train coaches of Dodgers RBI leagues to utilize a trauma focused lens while coaching youth. Reason being is that youth in underserved communities can be subjected to traumatic events which can affect them on and off the field. By providing a trauma focused lens, LADF is attempting to impact youthâ€™s social and emotional health outcomes which is unique in itself. In addition to trauma focused approaches, LADF is recruiting coaches from families of youth so that intergenerational play can take place. By doing so, we are encouraging participation from the entire family unit, empowering more Angelenos and engaging all communities of L.A. to PLAY. 
 
  As we complete field refurbishments and provide resources to play baseball/softball, we aim to holistically and directly address the play disparity in our communities. In this way, we are unique, aiming to empower ALL communities of LA to play.","LADF administers a comprehensive evaluation system for both Dreamfields and RBI, which provide direct insight on participantsâ€™ experiences, program elements, and community needs. LADF gathers qualitative data by conducting pre and post interviews, surveys, and focus groups with program participants, partners, volunteers, and community members. By doing so, LADF evaluates their programs and activations. This year the Hello Insight Sports Tool will be fully implemented to youth ages 9-18 at all RBI locations in Los Angeles. Hello Insight Sports Tool, is a youth development tool designed to help organizations evaluate social and emotional learning (SEL) amongst their youth. Last year, the sports tool was administered to Dodgers RBI players ages 9-18 at seven pilot locations. The tool focuses on development in the areas of: Academic Self-Efficacy, Contribution, Goal Orientation, Positive Identity, Self-Confidence, Self-Management, Social Capital, Social Connections, and Social Skills. The tool will allow Dodgers RBI staff to have instant access to the programâ€™s aggregated data to make data informed decisions about resources and training interventions for coaches and staff that can positively affect youth development outcomes. 
 
 Additionally, LADF will continue to measure the impact of the Dodgers Dreamfields program by selecting Dreamfield sites based on the following criteria: High need for youth baseball/softball recreation space, racial diversity, high park need metric, amount of youth living in the surrounding community, and current baseball/softball popularity and participation rates.","The $200,000 award from LA2050, allocated over a two-year period, will allow LADF to scale our operations for the activation of Angelenos in our Dodgers Dreamfields and Dodgers RBI programs. We will increase the number of residents that have access to vibrant parks by building more Dreamfields and incorporating more community activities at our field sites. We will also increase enrollment of kids in after-school programming by promoting Dodgers RBI, skills clinics, and fitness clinics, across Dreamfields and Los Angeles. Lastly, we will increase inter-generational opportunities for play by increasing coaches training and parent workshops to the community. This year, coaches' trainings will provide valuable insight regarding trauma focused approaches which will help with social and emotional learning. 
 
 Dodgers RBI incurs the following costs to conduct activities detailed for the LA2050 activation. The following are examples of program costs but are not limited to all program costs. $61,000 for college workshops. In efforts to enhance our college education series, our goal is to produce introductory college workshops for students in 8th-12th grades throughout Los Angeles. The core curriculum focuses on the basic college education requirements needed to successfully complete the application process. $28,200 for chartered buses in order to conduct college access tours for youth at no cost to them. $14,000 to fully implement the Hello Insight Sports Tool in order to evaluate Social and Emotional Learning for our Dodgers RBI youth ages 9-18. From these three activations, we will total $103,200 for Dodgers RBI. These activities make up 10% of the total program expenses for 2019 and contribute to Dodger RBIâ€™s current valuation of being a $1 million-dollar program.

 In addition to Dodgers RBI, LADF aims to revitalize spaces for play through our Dodgers Dreamfields program. The costs associated with revitalization of parks comes from the construction of new field sites, as well as maintenance of already developed Dreamfields. The costs associated with these activities may include but are not limited to: the installation of sod for new Dreamfields ($21,648), replacements and enhancements of previous Dreamfields ($22,000), soil preparation and compaction ($5,000), workshops and seminars for field maintenance across LA County ($2,500) and the development of other baseball/softball playing infrastructure, such as a community batting cage ($40,000) and installation of bullpens ($4,600). These activities total $86,148 in cost and make up 10% of Dreamfields total program expenses for 2019.

 TOTAL $95,748","The activation described will cost more than the amount requested, which LADF intends to cover with support from corporate sponsors, foundations, and individual donors. Corporate sponsors will provide financial and in-kind support for program activities of Dreamfields and RBI. Foundations will provide financial support to both programs. Individual donors provide support for our programming through in-stadium, campaigns, and event fundraising efforts. 
 
 In addition to our committed funders, LADF shares the costs of program activities by collaborating with local organizations and nonprofits. By partnering with these entities, LADF can maximize its engagement efforts for play in Los Angeles which makes it economically feasible for everyone. LADFâ€™S efforts make a collective impact that allow us to maintain programs of this magnitude and help activate 310,000 youth in Los Angeles to PLAY.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","Through Dodgers Dreamfields, we create vibrant spaces for communities to play and provide ample opportunities for community involvement at these sites. Through Dodgers RBI program, we aim to increase participation in baseball/softball by utilizing fitness clinics, baseball/softball clinics, mini festivals and MORE! We are confident that we will create access for over 310,000 youth this year alone, along with their families across 50 Dreamfields and 85 baseball/softball locations in the LA area.",['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)'],Lateral application (testing feasibility of a proven action/solution to a new issue or sector),"A story from RBI Coach Clemente Arrizon from Lincoln Park Recreation Center:
 
 â€œI had a young man who played baseball here go through some hard times. During his baseball season, his mother passed away. I got the call from his grandma during one of his practices and she was coming to pick him up. I brought him to the office with his grandma and we were able to talk together. The young man was sad, obviously. He cried but before he left to go be with his grandma, I told them to come back to the practice and games. Thereâ€™s a lot of gangs in our neighborhood, and I knew that this kid needed to stay involved. The team, the coach, and the structure helped him get through a hard time and stay safe. The park became his second home and it really, in my eyes, saved his life. I think that the Dodgers Foundation, the Dodgers Organization, all these sponsors.... they really need to know that. I know they cut a check and help communities, but they need to know that they are saving lives. I want to let them know that. You drive by from Monday to Saturday and the entire park is Dodger blue. The department of recreation and parks and management believe in me. With their support and Dodgers RBI we save lives, guide kids to college and make our community safer. But most importantly, Dodgers RBI gives us the opportunity to turn the T-Ball and Coach pitch players into responsible teens and it gives the minors, majors, junior baseball and girls softball players the opportunity to become responsible adultsâ€.","For Dodgers Dreamfields, we have collaborated with consistent partners that offer support from outside organizations. By doing so, this has enabled LADF to continue their impact of serving underserved communities by refurbishing and revitalizing field sites. The City of Compton Parks and Recreation Recreation Department, Kershawâ€™s Challenge, Easterseals, City of Fontana, Security Benefit, LA84 Foundation, Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, and San Manuel Band of Mission Indians have been instrumental in their support of our program. They provide LADF the capacity to contribute to the vibrancy of neighborhoods by creating and cultivating spaces for play in underserved communities. These committed supporters provide vital support needed for youth in economically challenged communities to play baseball and softball in Los Angeles. 
 
 In addition to these partners, LADF believes in the power of connectivity and collaboration within our programs to enhance our impact. As we aim to develop a robust network to promote, support, and create a movement for play in Los Angeles, we connect with various organizations and entities to enhance our activation efforts. Program sponsors and program partners of Dodgers Dreamfields and Dodgers RBI afford us the capacity to develop and sustain play efforts in Los Angeles by activating more youth, families, and communities by 2050. Bank of America, 99 Cents Only Stores, ARCO, County of LA Public Works, California Masonic Foundation, Helen and Will Webster Foundation, Under Armor Freedom Initiative, California Resources Corp & IBEW Local LA, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, UCLA Health and LA84 Foundation have demonstrated their commitment to the Dodgers RBI program by providing funding and in-kind support to our program.

Specifically, they help us organize fitness clinics, baseball and softball skills clinics, player/coach development workshops, and coaches training at our Dreamfields sites, to ensure that these community spaces remain vibrant for play.
 
 Affiliate partners through Dodgers RBI will also play an instrumental role in making our program a success. They engage with communities on the ground, to ensure that youth have access to baseball and softball programming in their community. This year, we will work with 13 affiliate partners and support them with resources to facilitate baseball and softball leagues. As an affiliate partner, they will receive team uniforms, equipment, promotional materials, and access to an online registration profile for baseball/softball leagues. With our partnership, they will have the resources necessary to enhance their leagues and reach more youth in their community.

 MLB Youth Academy in Compton",https://www.mlb.com/dodgers/community/foundation,development@dodgersfoundation.org,BIGGER THAN BASEBALL: Creating Major League Communities,LA is the best place to PLAY,$1 million +,,,,,"From 2014-2019, both Dreamfields and RBI programs have grown substantially within the LA community, from serving 2,700 RBI participants (2014) to 9,300 participants (2018) and refurbishing 50 Dreamfields across LA. LADF promotes play to a level that has increased access to parks, enrollment of kids in after-school programs, and increased opportunities for inter-generational play in LA. LADF has responded to the lack of LA park space in large urban zones by completing 50 Dodgers Dreamfields in some of the most underserved communities across LA. By doing so, we have created access for over 300,000 youth. LADF will not stop and recently committed to completing 50 additional Dreamfields by 2033 which will significantly impact PLAY in LA and help commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the Dodgers historic move to LA. This year, we will refurbish Dreamfields 51, 52, and 53. Our 51st Dreamfield will be designed for youth with special needs at Jack Bulik Park, located in the City of Fontana, an area in the Inland Empire that serves 3,000+ special needs children. This universally accessible field will meet the needs of individuals with both mental and physical disabilities. Dreamfields 52 and 53 will be located at Gonzales Park in Compton. With a 10,397-youth population and a poverty level of 26.60% refurbishing Gonzales Park can help increase park access and contribute to positively community outcomes. By refurbishing Jackie Robinson Stadium, this will help commemorate the 100th birthday of this remarkable baseball legend. 
 
  In 2019, LADF will serve over 10,500 youth in our RBI program, across 85 locations and in collaboration with 13 affiliate partners. This year, there will be significant growth in East Los Angeles and Long Beach and the City of Compton Parks and Recreation will join RBI with a total of 360 participants, ages 5-15 across 8 locations. We also anticipate growth in teams at additional locations throughout South Los Angeles. LADF has placed emphasis on growing girlsâ€™ participation in the sport by adding more softball teams throughout the program, creating more opportunities to play. On average, girlsâ€™ participation in RBI grows by a rate of 49% each year. In 2019, the RBI softball program will expand from 92 teams to 126 teams. This does not include the estimated 2,000 girls ages 5-12 that will play baseball in a co-ed format. Creating space for young women to play softball amongst their peers can be a valuable and empowering development zone, especially when coupled with a positive female coach/role model. Finally, RBI will partner with Up2Us Sports to implement trauma informed workshops to assist coaches positively engage with youth in low income communities who may experience stress and trauma. By providing these workshops LADF is attempting to help youth thrive in their environment regardless of the negative behaviors they may experience, ultimately ensuring that even the most vulnerable communities are ready to PLAY in LA.",Active,PLAY,,,Voting Period,
4842573260,UCLA Depression Grand Challenge: Humanizing and Destigmatizing Depression,"Depression is the worldâ€™s greatest health problem: itâ€™s common, it disables, it kills, itâ€™s costly, & itâ€™s not well-treated. UCLA leads an effort to understand, prevent, & treat depression.","The biggest challenge we face is convincing people to acknowledge their struggles with depression and anxiety. Because of shame and the fear of judgment and discrimination by others, it is a topic that is only recently becoming a more common part of the public discourse. 
 
 
 
 We recognize that the underlying basis for stigma and barriers to sharing oneâ€™s experience probably varies by such factors as gender, cultural and racial identity, sexual orientation, age, employment status, and geographic location. The proposed salons and digital content will be curated and crafted with an eye to inclusivity of diverse participants. Partnerships also will be formed with the idea of obtaining credible advocates for various population groups. With the right branding, thoughtful messaging, and broad engagement, we will take advantage of the zeitgeist within Millennials and Gen Z who already are engaging more openly in these conversations. All these efforts will, we believe, create a ripple effect of sharing of stories and narratives, with the ultimate effect of eroding stigma. 
 
 
 
 Addressing stigma is a critical factor for the overall UCLA DGC strategy which, among other objectives, seeks to initiate scalable treatment programs immediately. While we work to make them available, we can succeed only by creating an environment in which the community is open to and appreciates the importance of accessing these treatments, free from shame and judgment.","UCLAâ€™s focus is quite broad compared to others in the depression and stigma space. Specifically, as described earlier, we aim to understand, prevent and treat the worldâ€™s greatest health problem. What we propose for funding from LA2050 relates to our related objective of understanding and ending stigma and prejudice associated with depression, which we view as a critical step in reducing the burden of depression. Specifically, prejudice and stigma are among the key reasons that funding for depression research and treatment has long been disproportionately low compared to that allocated for disorders with a comparable public health impact; that people throughout the world are hesitant to seek help; and that people too often drop out of treatment. 
 
 
 
 There are a number of advocacy groups interested in depression and other mental illness-related stigma. Among these include Born this Way Foundation (Lady Gaga), Bring Change to Mind (Glenn Close), various university student groups (such as Active Minds), and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). We aim to reach new and existing audiences by partnering with groups already engaged in conversations around this topic and influencers not yet active in this space. We also plan to engage the Goldhirsh Foundation/LA2050 to identify additional partners and strategies.","Because the #1 goal is to humanize and disseminate powerful stories about depression and resilience, we plan to measure the number of stories shared, page views, click-throughs, likes, and comments on social media and existing platforms. To achieve this objective, we will carefully design every campaign and all content to be trackable online in order to analyze social media impressions and audience reach. 
 
 
 
 Other metrics that will be used to define and measure the projectâ€™s success include the following:
 
 â€¢ Partner buy-in to create 6 event experiences.
 
 
 
 â€¢ Identification of a platform and branding for content coming out of this set of projects.
 
 
 
 â€¢ Active engagement of participants at events, including the sharing of personal stories and/or engaging in event activities. 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Positive feedback from event participants collected via surveys.
 
 
 
 â€¢ Collection of a cross-section of peopleâ€™s personal experiences with depression through various channels that illustrate to Angelenos that depression does not discriminate, that it can affect anyone, and that it touches nearly everyoneâ€™s lives. 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Success with leveraging new and existing relationships to inform and solicit content.
 
 
 
 â€¢ Enlisting participants and others to serve as advocates for Awareness and Hope, beyond our planned events.
 
 
 
 â€¢ Adoption of programming/campaigns by influencers and partner organizations who may not have this type of advocacy as a core business function. 
 
 
 
 â€¢ Investment by other organizations or individuals to support the broader Awareness and Hope agenda.
 
 
 
 â€¢ Stretch goal metric: Increased interest on the part of groups and organizations in implementing the UCLA DGC scalable treatment model measured by inquiries and requests for meetings, though it may be hard to determine whether those inquiries are coming as a result of these activities or others.","Estimate Budget Item/Service

Total: $18,000
 
 
 
 UCLA Indirect Cost/Overhead: As is required for projects funded by foundations through the university, there is a 15% overhead rate. Total: $13,043. 
 
 
 
 Additional Terms: Please note that UCLA has some restrictions with respect to accepting certain grant terms. Ummi Sayers from our contracts and grants team submitted a letter on 3/27/2019 through the connect@la2050.org address, which outlines the terms that we will need to amend if we are fortunate to receive the award--these requests are consistent with the amendments made for our prior LA2050 award.","Additional costs and in-kind services will be covered from a modest Awareness & Hope budget already secured at UCLA, through the UCLA Research Enhancement Office, and through sponsorships with existing partner entities. We will share partnership information with LA2050/Goldhirsh Foundation offline but given that we have not yet solicited their participation for this activity, we are not comfortable listing them.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Strategy assistance and implementation', 'We are open to any and all types of partnerships with LA2050.']","A key UCLA DGC focus is raising awareness & hope, by understanding stigma & developing targeted strategies to defeat it. We propose an event series to spark conversation & empower LA to humanize depression. Discussions will inform digital media campaigns to be disseminated throughout LA & beyond. We will inspire participants to serve as advocates who share their experiences more broadly, putting real faces to the varied realities of those living with depression & those close to them.","['Westside', 'While the digital campaign will reach residents of the City of Los Angeles and beyond, we have not yet confirmed sites and partners for the 6 regional events. We expect to host them in different parts of the region, featuring one on the UCLA campus but others more widely dispersed.']",Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"You may be wondering how UCLA became focused on depression. The DGC is one of two UCLA Grand Challenges. There were a number of drivers that led UCLA to start a Grand Challenges initiative in 2012:
 
 â€¢ increasing UCLA's impact
 
 â€¢ inspiring larger interdisciplinary teams
 
 â€¢ increasing the visibility of UCLA's excellence
 
 â€¢ demonstrating UCLA's contributions to society
 
 â€¢ engaging the public
 
 
 
 We began with a pilot. Could we bring faculty members together and have them collectively identify a specific societal Grand Challenge to solve? At the start, we had no funding allocated for this effort & we were the 1st campus to declare its intent to solve a SMART-framed (Specific, Measurable, Aspirational, Relevant and Time-bound) issue. 
 
 
 
 Our pilot focused on the brain. We invited approximately 30 neuroscientists to a brainstorming session. They were asked, â€œwhat might be possible if money were not an obstacle?â€ We emerged with three topics and created workgroups that met weekly for 20 weeks. Depression became the focus of one of these groups; participants were motivated by a recent report by the World Health Organization projecting that, by 2030, depression will become the greatest single contributor to the global burden of disease. 
 
 
 
 This workgroup proposed that UCLA lead a world-wide effort to cut the burden of depression in half by 2050, and eliminate it by the end of this century. They recognized that UCLA was uniquely positioned to make a difference with basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience as well as social science and humanities expertise that would enable us to address depression from its biological underpinnings to the clinic, and the community at large. 
 
 
 
 Campus leadership chose to focus on depression because:
 
 â€¢ It is very common: 1 in 5 people are affected over their lifetimes
 
 â€¢ It disables: #1 cause of disability, worldwide
 
 â€¢ It kills: 1 person dies of suicide every 30 seconds
 
 â€¢ It is costly: > $200B cost to US economy annually
 
 â€¢ It is not well-treated: Â¾ are undiagnosed or ineffectively treated
 
 
 
 The UCLA DGC was publicly announced in late 2015. Other universities now look to UCLA as a model for moonshot-focused research. They too are inspired to partner with their communities to solve specific issues.","While we are not submitting a collaborative proposal, we have every intention of collaborating with external partners to execute the vision.

We recently engaged Ann Wang, UCLA alum & strategist, to help us build this council of thought leaders & local influencers. In collaboration with the council, we will execute three intertwined deliverables: 
 
 
 
 (1) Host approximately 6 salon events; 
 
 (2) Create & disseminate digital media campaign materials about depression; & 
 
 (3) Mobilize advocates. 
 
 
 
 We plan to leverage existing UCLA & new A&H Council relationships with both media & nonprofit entities to form partnerships to do the following:
 
 
 
 Salon Event Execution: We envision connecting with various advocacy organizations, leveraging the existing DGC Leadership Council & new A&H Council to select partners for each event & build invite lists. Salons will be intimate gatherings of ~30 thought-leaders from diverse industries, backgrounds, & cultures across LA. They will provide a forum for conversation, problem-solving, & creative expression, plus a venue for capturing images & stories. Each event will have a custom experience for participants, designed to break down walls & elicit strategies. Custom experiences may include poets drafting haiku and other artists capturing peopleâ€™s stories of depression/suicide. We target the first 5 events to be held within the first 8 months of the grant period. The 6th event either will follow a prior format or adopt a new format to accommodate more participants from the various communities together.
 
 
 
 Digital Campaign: We envision creating a digital campaign featuring depression, one story at a time, inspired by the â€œHumans of New Yorkâ€ portrait series. Using editorial photography & interview content gathered at the salons & independently through partnerships, we will share stories on Instagram, Facebook, & YouTube. These portraits will feature a diverse group that ranges from celebrities, entrepreneurs, & athletes to everyday people who describe the highs & lows of their journeys. Our goal is to humanize these stories to provide understanding, inspiration, & empathy regarding depression. Content to be routinely uploaded through the grant period.
 
 
 
 Mobilize Advocates: Through the salons & the digital campaign, we will identify and mobilize a group of advocates to disseminate the digital content, bring knowledge back from their communities, & generate partnerships that further help us shatter the stigma around mental health.
 
 
 
 Addressing stigma is critical for the UCLA DGC broader goal of enabling all Angelenos who need treatment to obtain it, & also for building more resilient individuals & communities, helping Los Angeles reach the aspiration of being the best place to Learn, Create, Play, Connect, & Live.

This is why we have partnered with the LA Chamber of Commerceâ€™s Bixel Exchange who has a long-standing relationship with their company partners in LA, who have actively participated in several of their past initiatives. They not only have strong relationships with representatives inside these companies, but also have the know-how to successfully navigate the recruitment and vetting of volunteer interviewees and the logistics to organize and execute a video shoot.","Careeronestop.org: Created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unfortunately, it is not Gen Z friendly. The design is stale, static and sterile. The career information is un-nuanced, nor is it practical or actionable in the real world. Gladeoâ€™s content is engaging, youth-friendly, and addresses the belief gap through diverse storytelling. By interviewing actual working professionals to get the â€œinsiderâ€ information that underserved students usually donâ€™t have access to through their own networks, we produce comprehensive, actionable, and extensively researched career profiles that help students not only get a full picture of what the career is really like, but also step-by-step guides and advice on how to prepare for, begin, and progress their journey in that career pathway.
 
 
 
 RoadtripNation.com: It has a lot of videos covering lots of careers, and the design is decent, but it doesnâ€™t give practical and actionable information, nor does it provide tools & resources needed to actually navigate a career pathway. Also, many of their resources are behind a paywall which makes it hard for students with limited resources to benefit from them. Gladeo.org is free and open to anyone and offers quality, first-hand, comprehensive information, inspirational and engaging career stories of relatable professionals, and then our platform connects students to relevant ed programs, online courses, professional associations & internship postings so they can move seamlessly through the school to career process. 
 
 
 
 The 3 most distinguishing characteristics of Gladeo.org are: 
 
 1. For Gen Z by Gen Z: Young, diverse people participate in our content creation process. This is why our content is not only comprehensive and inspirational but also youth-friendly. 
 
 2. Diversity: By intentionally highlighting the stories of diverse professionals from a range of racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, we help to diminish broader narrative and â€œself-perceptionâ€ barriers. 
 
 3. Connection and Activation: Our platform also serves as a hub that continuously connects our students to personally relevant local and online resources and opportunities which help them actively progress their career goals, including but not limited to scholarship opportunities, networking events, educational and training programs, industry seminars and webinars, paid internships, and other employment opportunities.","There are 2 programs working in synergy so we will define and measure success separately for each program involved in this project. We will conduct students surveys after completion of the Gladeo League program and 5 days after sign up on the online platform.

 â€œThe reason Gladeo is so important to us is because through Gladeoâ€™s career exploration workshop and free â€œVirtual Career Dayâ€platform, they are able to paint a picture of what it means to dream boldly and never let circumstances hinder their career and education aspirations. Many of our students come from a low socioeconomic background. Their parentsâ€™ English is minimal. There arenâ€™t too many books in the house. Both parents (if living with both parents) work full time. They relocate frequently because of income instability. These factors justify their way of having â€œsurvival mentalityâ€ and with that mindset, education or the future isnâ€™t something they often think about. â€œThatâ€™s for the other kids from the suburbs.â€ Gladeo sets the tone for CLH in that these kids are instilled within them the confidence to dream big and to step out of their fears. Gladeoâ€™s workshop and free online career platform which provide very practical tools to achieving specific career dreams helps our students step out of the ambiguity of ""itâ€™s too much work"", to the practicalities of â€œI can do it one step at a timeâ€. Every student who graduated from our first year cohort is now attending college. CLH and Gladeo played a HUGE role in that.â€ Steven Yu, Executive Director, Connect Lincoln Heights (CLH)

 A 2014 report from the Public Policy Institute of California predicts that by 2025, California will have an estimated 2.5 million unfilled jobs that will require at least some postsecondary education, with Information Technology slated to be the fastest growing sector. In addition, African American and Hispanic tech workers combined make up just 5% of the tech workforce. Students of increased socio-economic status are many times gifted with career orientation early in their youth. Students of lower economic means fail to benefit from career orientation from their parents or community. So how do they aspire to and pursue careers theyâ€™ve never heard of? Our project aims to bridge the following gaps at scale: 
 
 
 
 - Information gap: What careers exist? What do they entail and what are the education and steps necessary to get your foot in the door? 
 
 - Belief gap: How many underrepresented minorities are not pursuing careers in the technology sector because they donâ€™t see or know anyone who looks like them doing it or because theyâ€™ve been told they are not as capable?

4902060238,Spark Program Inc,"Spark Program, Inc (Spark) engages communities to provide career exploration and self-discovery opportunities that help middle school students understand, experience and pursue whatâ€™s possible.","Spark provides a turn-key program for our corporate partners in an effort to maintain high program quality, fidelity, and participant satisfaction. We are also invested in providing high-touch, high-impact opportunities for our students. With that comes a cost. Our program components - fall Labs and spring Mentorships - are hosted at the offices of our partners - 1. Because it is important for us to expose students to different work environments, for them to feel welcomed and accepted in those environments, and because itâ€™s fun for them and 2. It is more convenient for our employee volunteers to walk down the hall then travel across the city during their workday. We also highly value student safety so the organization commits to transporting students to and from school on private buses equipped with Spark staff chaperones. Transportation costs in addition to expenses like program materials, mentor background checks and training, maintaining an online resource portal, and curriculum development and evaluation add up. 
 
 
 
 A challenge the organization faces, common amongst volunteer-based organizations, is helping our corporate partners understand the fees associated with running a program even when volunteering is â€œfree.â€ Spark is committed to re-evaluating how we communicate our unique value proposition to our partners, in addition to our fee structure, to ensure the long term sustainability of our program. Opportunities like the LA2050 Challenge are a great way for the organization to raise its local profile and awareness for the work we do, as well as help solidify our messaging and get the word out on the reputable impact of our programming.","At the core of Sparkâ€™s work is connecting partner companies and their passionate employees with local students. Sparkâ€™s school partners include teams of mission-aligned educators committed to collaboration to enhance student outcomes. Spark also has formal agreements with school districts that allow for critical data sharing, enabling Spark to evaluate its programâ€™s impact on school-based performance indicators such as attendance, behavior, classroom engagement, and grades. Spark is also an affiliate member of MENTOR, the National Partnership for Mentoring, where we collaborate with like-minded organizations and share best practices.
 
 
 
 While organizations like City Year, Junior Achievement, and Citizen Schools also focus on academic achievement and career-readiness, what differentiates Spark is our strategic focus on students in the middle grades as well as our ability to integrate classroom learning with experiences outside of the school day. Additionally, organizations like Big Brothers Big Sisters similarly provide mentorship opportunities, however, they tend to focus more on relationship building and less on tangible skills. Spark created and designed its own curriculum that is rooted in research that guides each step of our program. Students and mentors not only develop rapport and relationships but also collaborate on distinct skill-building opportunities and exercises outlined in our weekly activities.","In 2017, Spark was awarded the first-ever US2020 Stem Mentoring Award for Excellence in Impact Measurement. We highly value evaluation and are constantly looking for ways to enhance our programming. Spark evaluates program effectiveness based on studentsâ€™ academic and social-emotional development in areas associated with high school, college, and career success. Our rigorous evaluation includes the collection of quantitative and qualitative data from students, mentors, and teachers at three points throughout the program as well as data collected and shared from school districts. This 360-view assesses student progress toward target outcomes, such as the ability to develop the skills, connections, and engagement needed to graduate from high school and continue down a path of academic and career achievement.
 
 
 
 Our research-based curriculum is designed around three central pillars of success: Social-emotional learning skills, social capital, and performance and engagement in school. Social-Emotional Skills include self-awareness, self-management, and decision making, while Social Capital focuses on growing awareness of and access to relationships and resources for educational and career success. Performance / Engagement looks at key indicators like student grades, attendance, and behavior. Success in all three of these skill areas is correlated with high school graduation, academic achievement, secondary education completion, and employability. 
 
 
 
 Our data consistently shows students participating in Spark programs growing in their social-emotional competencies and social capital. Corroborating school data also shows that students are simultaneously improving in other areas of success such as academic performance and school attendance. In the last school year, 86% of Spark students grew in social-emotional skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and communication, 99% of Spark students report learning about different jobs and careers they didnâ€™t know about before Spark, 90% of Spark students improved in critical competencies for successful classroom engagement. Significantly, organization-wide 92% of Spark alumnus are on track to graduate high school on time compared to 68% of their peers.","Generous support from the LA2050 Challenge would enable Spark in LA to provide transformational learning opportunities to some of the cityâ€™s most at-risk young people. $100,000 would allow nearly 70 Los Angeles 7th and 8th graders to participate in Sparkâ€™s high touch year-long Lab and Mentorship and subsequent High School Pathways program.

These revenue streams include: Individual donors, led by our passionate and dedicated Executive and Advisory Board Members; Foundations including longstanding relationships with the Johnny Carson Foundation, Fineschriber Foundation, and Focusing Philanthropy; Program fees, through which all schools commit to $25,000 per school year; our growing Corporate partners which include Cornerstone OnDemand, Wells Fargo, City National Bank, and Warner Bros; and lastly special events such as our Annual Spark the Summer fundraiser in June.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","Spark was founded with a simple belief, that regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status, all young people deserve opportunities to explore who they can become. Recognizing that not all communities have the same access to the resources that inspire successful futures, Spark aims to equalize the playing field for students by connecting them to meaningful workplace mentorships throughout Los Angeles. In partnership with passionate LA community members, we show young people what's possible.","['Central LA', 'South LA', 'Westside', 'LAUSD']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"Spark was founded by two educators in the Bay who saw a troubling gap between schools and their surrounding communities. Middle school students were confined to classrooms and disengagedâ€” a world apart from the wealth of resources that neighboring businesses had to offer. Spark was founded on the belief that all young people should be inspired to explore who they can become, and all adults have a role in supporting them in that journey. 
 
 
 
 Throughout our work, we often hear that the impact goes well beyond academic and career readiness - itâ€™s life-changing. Not only do our students develop new skills and learn about new environments, but they also deepen their understanding of themselves, their interests, and their dreams. Spark Alumni Myra is a perfect example.
 
 
 
 Spark first met Myra when she was an 8th grader in LA. Like many of Myraâ€™s schoolmates, her parents were immigrants and never went to college. Despite that, the importance of education was imparted to Myra early on. When she was only 9 years old, her father was deported. Just a few years later her mom faced a serious medical illness. Her family was struggling. 
 
 
 
 At Bethune Middle School, Myra learned about Spark. She reports signing up for the program because she â€œwanted to have someone guide me.â€ Myra was matched for mentorship to Perry, CFO & Co-Founder of Cornerstone OnDemand. Together, they explored Myra's interest in opening up a coffee shop, a real-life dream for her family. With Perry's collaboration, Myra learned how to launch a business and research peer companies in that industry. She worked hard on skills like public speaking and communication, an area she reported initially lacking confidence in. ""Perry was a mentor in many ways, not just career-wise, but also life-wise."" Myra's bond with Perry was so fortified that he and his family attended her High School graduation to cheer her on. They remain close.
 
 
 
 Myra is now enrolled at the University of California, Santa Cruz. She returned to the Spark in LA this summer - this time as an intern! Despite the adversity she faced early on, Myra was determined to succeed in school and continue on a path to pursue her dreams.

The path to dropping out begins well before then. Research shows that middle school is a troubling turning point for students when up to 60% become chronically disengaged. This lack of engagement is often exacerbated by under-resourced schools and perceived lack of opportunity. Through the powerful combination of mentoring, hands-on learning, and access to resources, Los Angeles Unified School District students participating in Spark develop the motivation, skills, and relationships necessary to successfully transition to high school, a significant contributor of a longer-term trajectory of success.
 
 
 
 Spark in LA offers a three-pronged program model that combines mentorship with opportunities for skill development across three pillars of success: social-emotional learning, social capital and school performance and engagement. Students begin in the fall of 7th Grade with Spark Labs, structured workshops held at different companies across Los Angeles where students and volunteers explore various career options through self-discovery activities. In spring, students progress to an intensive 13-week mentorship with an employee volunteer. As students enter 8th grade, High School Pathways helps them identify school options that are a fit for their unique needs through workshops and Sparkâ€™s interactive online tool. 
 
 
 
 By re-engaging students during a critical time of development, Spark helps students get on the right path for high school graduation. In fact, 92% of Spark Students have graduated or are on track to graduate on time, compared to an average of 68% in the districts Spark serves. High school graduation is an important milestone that goes beyond a piece of paper. High School graduates across the board have better outcomes than those who drop out. Most notably, graduates are less likely to be unemployed, engage in criminal behavior, have poor health, and live in poverty. Graduating from high school empowers students to break the cycle of poverty, which has a profound impact on each individual and communities at large. In fact, graduating half a class of high school dropouts would save US taxpayers $45 billion that year alone. 
 
 
 
 Moreover, through our program, we are helping young people discover whatâ€™s possible and develop the skills they need to make their dreams a reality. Through hands-on, experiential learning opportunities, Spark is fueling studentsâ€™ awareness of and interest in different career paths and in turn, helping to diversify the employment pipeline in years to come. Lastly, through our expansive network of company partners, Spark is providing meaningful opportunities for employees to learn about, connect to, and make a difference in diverse communities across LA.",,,,Active,LEARN,,,Voting Period,
4916509742,Youth Policy Institute,Youth Policy Instituteâ€™s mission is to reduce poverty in Los Angeles using a holistic approach and comprehensive services to enable a successful transition from cradle to college and career.,"A potential barrier for the Green Team comes in form of sustainability and expansion in future years, as the program requires sustained funding, oversight, and enrollment to continue. However, YPI has already made great strides in overcoming this obstacle and identified numerous pathways to sustain the program. YPI is working with our partners at the City of LA to create dedicated summer youth employment spots, which would allow us to place youth on the Green Team and pay them through this City-funded program. We will also work with representatives from numerous City departments to find a sustainable way to continue the program. The Program Coordinator will be responsible for creating a detailed implementation guide to support replication and expansion of the program; this guide will be shared with City partners and local nonprofit agencies as we continue pursuing sustainability of the program into the future.","While there are other agencies who operate similar programming, none offer the holistic opportunity for on-the-job training, community engagement, and positive youth development that participation on the Green Team provides. For example, LA Conservation Corps offers similar on-the-job opportunities in cleanup services and has a focus on opportunity youth, but we enhance this model by placing a premium on hiring youth from within the local community to maintain authentic community engagement and involvement, as well as in offering trauma-informed supportive services to Green Team members. 
 
 
 
 YPI operates YouthSource Centers, which provide supportive services, job training, workforce development, financial empowerment, and case management services to transition aged-youth, the same population targeted for this program. We will leverage our exciting infrastructure to ensure that youth are supported in accessing additional services, allowing us to provide a more comprehensive network of support than other agencies may be able to provide. These supportive services ensure that youth are not only given the opportunity to grow their professional experience through our program but also meet personal basic needs, like having the means to get to work, buy food, and receive ongoing case management. 
 
 
 
 Finally, participation on our Green Team is oriented around social justice: our participants develop the necessary advocacy and community organization skills to reclaim community spaces. Our youth will play a vital role in the project by working with partner organizations, like LAPD, RAP, and local businesses, to create community-driven collective impact that helps revitalize MacArthur Park as a community space.","The goal of the Green Team is to make MacArthur Park a safe and accessible place for the community to gather and play through a job creation program for local youth. Through a program that activates local youth and the community at large to reclaim their park, we hope to decrease per capita crime rates and increase the number of residents with easy access to a vibrant park. The project is also designed to decrease youth unemployment by providing job training and work experience for high-need youth. 
 
 
 
 To move the needle on these LA2050 indicators, YPI will measure project success by tracking the number of graffiti removals, neighborhood cleanups, and other beautification projects facilitated by the team at the end of each cohort. To promote activation of the park and community engagement in the Green Team project, the team will provide 12 community workshops at the MacArthur Park Community Center. 
 
 
 
 As a job creation program, the Green Team will be successful if 20 youth are enrolled over one year and 17 youth complete the program. The 85% projected retention rate is based on our existing paid work experience programs and takes into account the high and varied needs of youth in the Pico-Union and Westlake communities. The Green Team will provide wraparound services to support Green Team members in meeting their basic needs, such as connections to housing services, case management, and a living wage, to help them continue the program and go on to stable employment. 
 
 
 
 The Green Team is a place-based project focused on reclaiming and revitalizing the MacArthur Park community and, as such, YPI places a high priority on Green Team participants being from the community. We will collect most recent address information during enrollment and onboarding to ensure 100% of members reside in the Westlake or Pico-Union areas. 
 
 
 
 Finally, the Green Team will measure success on the creation of two deliverables: a crime incident reporting database designed by an AmeriCorps VISTA member for local businesses and a program manual of best practices created by the Program Coordinator to guide and streamline future implementation.","YPI will use grant funding to fund wages for a Green Team Program Coordinator, an AmeriCorps VISTA member, Green Team members, as well as program supplies, mileage reimbursement, and indirect costs as detailed below.

A team of local, at-risk youth will lead efforts to reclaim the space and partner with park maintenance and local businesses. They will host events to activate the park as a community gathering space while building relevant skills for career success. The Green Team helps youth advance sustainable change in their community and at MacArthur Park.",['Central LA'],Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"At YPI, we believe that the key to breaking the cycle of poverty is holistic, integrated resources that support families across their days and their lives. Our services are individualized to meet individualsâ€™ specific needs and harness the power of human interaction to create lasting connections between our staff, our participants, and the communities we serve. For example, Emily, a participant in our Girls & Gangs juvenile re-entry program, described her relationship with her Case Manager, Vanessa, as crucial to her success: â€œWhen I first met Vanessa, she said, â€˜I will be there for you.â€™ I did not believe her back thenâ€¦. Vanessa has been there for me. She even went to my graduation: my mom couldnâ€™t goâ€¦. Sometimes water is thicker than blood.â€ After being incarcerated at 14, Vanessa has stable employment and is raising a daughter. The Green Team will rely on the power of relationships like Emily and Vanessaâ€™s to support Green Team members as they revitalize MacArthur Park and build skills for career success. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 To turn community inspiration into sustainable impact, YPI helps individuals empower themselves to achieve their own goals and build up their communities. To achieve this, we prioritize hiring staff from the communities we serve who bring to their task a unique understanding of the barriers youth face and can be role models as well as tutors, teachers, and coaches. Through this practice, we hope to inspire youth to be the change in their communities. Jonathan, a student in YPIâ€™s GEAR UP college-readiness programming, worked with his classmates to create Safe-Way, a software system to help homeless and at-risk families navigate services and find stable housing. Jonathan is now a junior in high school and received a $20,000 scholarship to attend university, where he plans to study computer science and continue developing Safe-Way. Like Jonathan, the Green Team members will lead efforts to support and reclaim their community.",YPI will partner with the LA Department of Recreation & Parks (RAP) to ensure that Green Team activities support and enhance existing work.

The Green Team will serve a vibrant but historically underserved community facing numerous barriers to success. 72% of residents live below 185% of the federal poverty level, the cutoff for WIC eligibility (American Community Survey [ACS], 2017) and face poverty-related barriers including food insecurity, housing instability, and underserved schools. The project will target out-of-school youth, many of whom are also not employed. Unemployment among youth ages 16-24 is 20%, higher than the City-wide youth unemployment rate of 17% and City-wide adult unemployment rate of 4% (ACS, 2017). 
 
 
 
 The Green Team will take a holistic approach to neighborhood revitalization by empowering at-risk youth to play a key role in their community and make MacArthur Park a safe and welcoming place to PLAY. Our strategy takes a well-rounded approach to revitalizing the park, focusing on direct cleanup services, local businessâ€™ revitalization efforts, and community activation, all with the goal of elevating MacArthur Park as a vibrant community gathering space.
 
  
 
 Green Team members will support ongoing community engagement work in and around MacArthur Park, enhancing YPIâ€™s strategy to improve safety by activating the park and having community members act as â€œnatural guardians.â€ The team will lead community engagement workshops, stepping up as community leaders and using their connections to the community to inform future activation strategies. 
 
 
 
 Youth will assist the LA Department of Recreation and Parks (RAP) with daily park maintenance, community cleanups, and identifying areas of the park that need additional support. Four Green Team members will complete hazardous waste disposal training in order to assist RAP staff with removal of used needles, which currently shut down large areas of the park until City officials arrive to dispose of them safely. 
 
 
 
 Green Team efforts will also target the streets around the park, partnering with local small businesses to identify hot spots and lead community cleanups and beautification activities. The Green Team will promote adoption of an incident database, developed by a YPI AmeriCorps VISTA Member, to streamline reporting and data analysis of vandalism and burglary as a tool for crime response and prevention.

GCPEAâ€™s work is done by parent volunteers.,"Working with college administration to follow the proper procedures for this construction project may introduce unforeseen delays into our timeline. To overcome this challenge, we will start working on the project immediately after receiving the grant to make sure we allow plenty of time for all parties involved to sign off. We will also need to take college schedules and parking needs into consideration because the playground area is adjacent to a heavily utilized parking lot.","There are other Parent Ed programs in the LA area. Most are organized by parks and recreation departments without the oversight, structure, and educational content accorded our program through its link with a college. All Parent Ed programs share similar goals in creating an environment geared for learning and development by both the parent and the child through observation, participation in classroom activities and class discussion. The courses in Glendale are offered tuition-free, which is a distinction with other programs which charge a fee. Most programs donâ€™t have the same facilities as ours, with a dedicated location at the Life Skills Building on campus at Glendale College serving only our program. This facility houses age-appropriate educational materials and classroom furniture in addition to the outdoor space with playground and toys.","Our â€œRenovate and Expand Outdoor Playgroundâ€ project will be successful when the play area fully transforms into an age-appropriate outdoor classroom. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following results:
 
 
 
 -The playground meets current trends in early childhood learning. It provides a place for children to explore, imagine, exercise and learn to work together in a safe and age-appropriate environment. It is accessible to children with diverse abilities, including physical or mobility differences, neurodiversity, and the full range of ages we serve. It features a new toddler area, allowing a safe space for our younger children to play. Updated preschool equipment promotes socialization and cooperative play, including a science area, a music wall, and open ended equipment. New landscaping, privacy screening added to the fencing, a shade awning, and replaced safety surfacing complete the overhaul and improve the learning environment.
 
 
 
 -These new features greatly enhance the facility and draw families to the program. The playground meets the programâ€™s needs today and into the future.
 
  
 
 -Parents use their time in the space to create a network of connections with other parents, learn, and build confidence in their ability to parent. Not only are the parents observing and guiding their own children; they are observing othersâ€™ children as well. Part of the Parent Education curriculum involves learning to work with other people's children in a developmentally appropriate way. While in the play area, parents practice skills learned during the child development instruction portion of the class. They learn to anticipate potential problems, help children resolve conflicts, practice age-appropriate discipline techniques, and identify and prevent potential safety hazards. Parents learn to work together in this space and develop connections with other families which creates a stronger community and understanding of different cultures.
 
 
 
 In addition to completing the construction project, we will also measure success by doing the following: 
 
 
 
 -Conduct pre- and post-student and teacher satisfaction surveys to determine the extent to which the outdoor space redesign meets our stated goals

With classes for parents of infants through age five, we are able to reach families early, across the spectrum of income and educational levels. We are open to all. We are more than a Parent Education program and even more than an early childhood preschool environment. What we teach has immediate impact on a child, a family, a classroom, school, and community. The impact continues into that childâ€™s future - their family, school and community. Further, it goes on to impact the next generation, not only because behaviors are learned and imitated, but because solid parenting skills nurture and grow successful people. Parenting skills run through the whole fabric of life.
 
 
 
 We would also like to briefly explain about the funding of our organization. Parent Education is a â€œtuition-freeâ€ program, although itâ€™s not free to run. Glendale College pays for the facility, teachers, and assistants. GCPEA operates under the fundraising arm of the college, the Glendale College Foundation.

The money raised by the GCPEA executive committee provides much-needed teaching tools and classroom enhancements including art supplies, children books, toys, tricycles, musical equipment, tables, chairs, storage sheds and much more. Larger improvement projects have no way of currently being funded. Without site upgrades, the program will suffer and will not be able to continue to reach the same number of families, expand, and continue providing a relevant program to the current and future community.","GCPEA is the lead organization with responsibility for designing and implementing this project.

 POPULATION BEING SERVED
 
 Approximately 250 families participate in our tuition-free programs. Adult participants include mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and grandfathers. The children are ages birth - five years. Parents of varying education levels share concerns side by side, support each other, and learn that parenting concerns and the desire for strong family bonds are universal. Families who attend come from diverse backgrounds and socioeconomic levels and without this program, being free and self-funded, many of these families wouldnâ€™t have access to early childhood and parent education. Classes are offered throughout the week, including evenings and weekends, to meet scheduling needs of working parents. 
 
 
 
 Participants live in Glendale and the surrounding cities. The ethnicity of adult students enrolled in 2016-2018 was as follows: Asian/Pacific Islander - 13.8%; Latino/Hispanic - 11.1%; Caucasian/Anglo - 21.5%; Caucasian/Armenian - 43%; Other/not stated - 10%.

She read through several books every week and when she didn't have something new to read would resort to re-reading the family encyclopedia set. Fortunately, growing up by the ocean gave her a keen appreciation for the ocean and the environment. As a surfer, she was exposed to sea life, including sharks and became the first to go to college and grad school in her family. 
 
 
 
 One day while surfing at El Porto in the South Bay in 2013, Boyle encountered a juvenile white shark in the water near her. Many others had also encountered these animals and it wasn't long before the local news was showing up almost daily to ask surfers if they were afraid of sharks. It was creating quite an unnecessary panic and Boyle decided to start the El Porto Shark project. It started as a digital awareness campaign to advocate shark conservation.
 
 
 
 There are 75% fewer great white sharks today than when the 1975 movie ""Jaws"" was released and nearly 100 million sharks are killed every year. Deaths occur from fisheries, culling, overfishing, and finning. We have ""dolphin safe"" tuna, but not ""shark safe"" and this needs to change for the overall health of the planet.
 
 
 
 In 2015 Boyle was inspired to do more and started doing more active advocacy and consulted with NGOs such as Los Angeles Maritime Institute, Waterfront Education, and Heal the Bay. She is now completing the steps to have EPS become an official non-profit in order to focus more on research, education, and advocacy. Initial focus projects include turning surfers into citizen scientists and shark advocates as well as bringing shark and ocean conservation education to underserved students and families.

 It's important for these underserved communities to understand their role in shark and ocean conservation as they are typically the most affected by climate change. We aim to teach them not only quality STEAM topics, but how to be Citizen Scientists and what they can do to better their environment and the oceans. Regardless of where they live, they cam be empowered ocean and shark advocates. Not only will the students LEARN, but their families as well.

5143325317,P.S. ARTS,P.S. ARTSâ€™ mission is to improve the lives of children by providing arts education to underserved public schools and communities.,"P.S. ARTS is encouraged that, in spite of the severe financial constraints public schools face, more than 30% of our total revenue comes from school district allocated funds. This contribution on the part of the schools (compared to an average of less than 10% of income generated by similar arts education nonprofits) is an endorsement of the quality and positive impact of P.S. ARTS programs. In an effort to advance equity and excellence, we leverage our schoolsâ€™ support to secure funding from other institutional funders, including corporate, foundation, and government funders. Like many other nonprofit organizations, we have encountered challenges in finding grant opportunities and securing unrestricted funds, which enable us to invest in administrative staff who support our programs department. Unrestricted support is critical to ensuring the quality of our programs, funding professional development, capacity building for our administrative staff, and program evaluation. It also funds the time and resources necessary to build and strengthen P.S. ARTSâ€™ relationships with our schools, ensuring our fruitful, collaborative partnerships with the districts we serve. To overcome this challenge, we have invested in cultivating relationships with new funding partners and devoted more resources to individual giving.","P.S. ARTS is the only organization in Central and Southern California to provide high-quality arts education in dance, music, theater, and visual arts â€“ both in the classroom and after school â€“ to every child in a school for the full school year. The P.S. ARTS model is unique in the depth and breadth of our service program in comparison to similar arts education nonprofits.
 
 
 
 Our long-term goal is to be a best-in-class organization providing rigorous, high quality arts education to public school students who would not otherwise have access to this Federally mandated curriculum component. Our approach is innovative in that we do not force a prescriptive curriculum or content emphasis on schools. Instead, P.S. ARTS' CEO and programs staff have developed a rigorous framework for providing state and national standards-based arts education that can be customized to fit the individual needs and priorities of a school or district. While all P.S. ARTS programs meet research-based standards for the amount of direct instruction provided, the qualifications and on-going training of Teaching Artists, and measurable academic and social benefit to students, our model can be tailored for cultural relevance and academic priorities.
 
 
 
 At P.S. ARTS, we believe that sequential, discipline-based arts instruction belongs in the school day alongside other core subjects and we have modeled our programs accordingly. Whereas most arts service organizations in Southern California provide the arts as enrichment programming or short-term residencies, P.S. ARTS programs are based on a â€œmastery model,â€ providing sequential, year-long, in-school programs as well as interest and/or talent-based after-school programming. P.S. ARTS is also committed to a sustained, reliable presence at our partner schools. In fact, P.S. ARTSÊ¼ long-term commitment has been noted as a major strength in a program evaluation conducted by a former Harvard Business School non-profit program sustainability analyst. It is our intention to provide the necessary tools and training to our partner schools to allow classroom teachers and school administration to implement and maintain a high-quality arts program should P.S. ARTS ever close its doors. While we recognize that most public schools do not have the staff capacity or financial resources to fulfill the same responsibilities that P.S. ARTS currently manages, including curriculum review, evaluations, and fundraising, we strive to leave behind a knowledge base that promotes program sustainability.","We define success as progress made on the following goals and objectives:
 
 
 
 Goal 1: Advance knowledge, skills, and social-emotional assets linked to success in school, work, and life. Objectives include: 
 
 a) Students will increase their knowledge in the arts and enrich their learning in other academic subjects. 
 
 b) Students will develop skills to become more engaged, proactive, and broadminded learners. 
 
 c) Students will develop social-emotional assets, including creative, critical thinking, and collaboration abilities.
 
 
 
 Goal 2: Curriculum and instruction is inclusive, celebrates diversity, and reflects current education standards, policies, and best practices. Objectives include:
 
 a) Teachers will exhibit a depth of expertise in their arts disciplines.
 
 b) Teachers will deliver lessons that are inclusive, culturally responsive, and reflective of current education standards and best practices.
 
 c) Teachers will use instructional strategies that foster studentsâ€™ development of social-emotional assets.
 
 d) Teachers will support student learning outside the arts classroom.
 
 
 
 Goal 3: Contribute to a welcoming and aspirational learning environment. Objectives include:
 
 a) Develop positive and collaborative relationships with schools.
 
 b) Maintain an inclusive, aspirational, and enriched learning environment.
 
 c) Model good citizenship and civic leadership.
 
 
 
 Goal 4: Increase intergenerational engagement and enhance community dynamics in partner schools. Objectives include:
 
 a) Increase intergenerational interaction and family/community involvement.
 
 b) Foster the preservation/celebration of community arts and culture.
 
 c) Support arts-based school improvement.
 
 
 
 P.S. ARTS measures success using an internal protocol consisting of four evaluation instruments: 
 
 
 
 The Curriculum Quality Review Rubric is completed by Program Managers prior to the program start. Course syllabi and unit maps are given an aggregated score between 1 (Not Addressed) and 5 (Addressed In-depth) in: Student Success, Effective Teaching, Positive School Climate, and Engaged Community.
 
 
 
 The Site Visit Evaluation Rubric is completed twice yearly by P.S. ARTS Programs Staff. Teaching artists are observed for a minimum of 50 minutes and given an aggregated rating between 1 (Not Yet) and 4 (Confidently) for demonstration of Effective Teaching strategies and teaching artist contribution to a Positive School Climate and an Engaged Community.
 
 
 
 The Student Visual and Performing Arts Performance Rubric is completed by teaching artists to measure studentsâ€™ visual and performing arts skills proficiency on a scale of 1 (Developing) to 3 (Exceptional).
 
 
 
 The School Site Personnel Feedback Survey is completed by teachers and administrators. It provides feedback on the impact of the P.S. ARTS program on students and the broader school community.","Funding from LA2050 will support the following:
 
 
 
 Faculty Salaries: $73,540

 All funding will be allocated to P.S. ARTS to support the implementation of the Classroom Studio across seven school districts in Los Angeles County.","P.S. ARTS secures funding through a variety of avenues, including fundraising events, direct appeals, and grant requests. We plan to seek renewed funding from current public and private donors in the coming year, as well as cultivate new relationships with corporate and foundation funders. Moreover, P.S. ARTS established its endowment in 2015 with a $1M matching grant from the Herb Alpert Foundation. The endowment generates additional unrestricted funds, helping offset any potential threats to our ability to fund our programs. Each of these funding sources help P.S. ARTS maintain the high-quality programs for which we are known.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","P.S.

Her enthusiasm for her work and love for her students is overwhelmingly clear through their energy and excitement in each class and their incredible performances. She shared this memorable student experience: 
 
 
 
 Some students I have who have autism learned our play and performed it earlier this week. Each young actor had successes and moments where they seemed engaged and excited. However, I worried that Sam, in particular, was not very engaged by the play and struggled to stay on task. Sam is a nice kid but it just seemed that this wasnâ€™t their â€œthing.â€ Just now, Sam and their classmates came in to watch another fifth-grade class perform the same play. As Sam watched from the audience of parents and school staff, the excitement in recognizing the play grew and grew! Sam began singing the songs, doing the movements, and ended up standing up in the middle of the audience and jumping up and down applauding and laughing during the show! Sam especially loved the girl who played the frogâ€”which was originally Samâ€™s part. Samâ€™s teachers and I were quite surprised and delightedâ€”and the class performing LOVED Samâ€™s reactions! It made THEM become more engaged. They began performing for SAM! It turned into a joyous experience for the audience and the cast â€“ and especially for Sam! What a thrill to see them connect so personally as Sam recognized their show being performed by others.","The schools we serve are the most critical partners in the success of our programs. P.S. ARTS program staff and teaching artists are active in our partner schoolsâ€™ districts and communities, participating in faculty meetings, PTA meetings, and school events where they interact with administrators and parents.

The program engages students through an Arts Intensive in a single fine arts discipline or a series of Arts Rotations covering multiple fine arts disciplines during the entire school year, depending on a school or districtâ€™s needs and goals. Curricular content is framed by a unifying theme, following a customizable scope and sequence in alignment with current state and national arts education standards. Teaching artists frame lessons around studentsâ€™ curiosity and interests and incorporate artists and artworks that represent a broad range of lived experiences, cultures, eras, abilities, and perspectives. In-school arts instruction is supplemented with community engagement activities, including our popular Family Art Nights, which provide opportunities for families to make art together, as well as our open class â€œinformancesâ€ which enable parents to learn alongside their children.

 JOY FACTORY started in 2015 as a spontaneous birthday fundraiser for former BBC news journalist and Producer, Susannah Orchard to help rehabilitate Syrian refugee families. This first birthday festival brought 250 people all paying $45 which raised $8k for Save the Children to buy enough blankets to keep 900 Syrian families warm during the winter months in Lebanon. Since then, the fundraisers have been attended by up to 600 people and featured artists such as Conrad Sewell, Turbotito, Grizfolk, DJ Goldierocks, Restavrant, Puscie Jones, Henry Pope and many more, as well as live artists, art auctions, whisky and tequila sponsors, beer and wine, Pizzanista, Myintent and Photobooths.

 Early membership: Beginning soon with 'Wednesdays at JOY FACTORY', within the month you'll be able to enjoy an art opening, movie night, Factory Forum talks with cocktails and compelling speakers addressing possible solutions and providing research about the root of the homelessness crisis in LA. The 4th Wednesday will be the art closing, and for every month that has a 5th Wednesday, we'll have a supper club. All of these events will have a live music element and respect and support for new rising artists will be a big part of what we seek to do, giving a platform and consciously elevating everyone who performs at the clubhouse. Our full tiered membership model is below, and we'll be working towards this and increasing the itinerary and price packages of new memberships as we evolve.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,
5300848697,Human Rights Foundation,HRF's Art in Protest Program seeks to aid artists living under authoritarian regimes or whose work is connected to their countries' struggle for democracy and basic human rights.,"The major barrier we have had to expanding the impact of this program has been finances. We have the capability to pull off amazing events, and have access to some of the bravest voices fighting oppression around the world. We simply haven't had the resources to celebrate their work on the proper scale. Our work is usually well received, but occasionally we have been met at our events by protestors representing the governments of Cuba, China, or North Korea who exercise their right to protest in a free country, but seek to silence those exercising their right in a way they find displeasing. We welcome this opposition, and how that through engagement, we can create a dialogue about free speech and censorship at home and abroad.","There are many organizations such as Index on Censorship that support the work of dissident artists, but as far as I know, Art in Protest is the only organization focusing specifically on supporting artists using their work to fight dictatorship and authoritarianism. This will continue to be the cornerstone of our work, as, unfortunately dictatorship is spreading throughout the globe.","We will measure our success through several criteria:
 
 
 
 1) Social Media - We aim for the social media following of the featured artist to gain considerably from collaboration with other artists exposure to new audiences.
 
 
 
 2) Attendance - Over the course of a month-long exhibit, we hope for 3,000 attendees to the exhibit for each show, so around 6,000 unique engagements per year. If this is showcased in a public space, however this could increase significantly.
 
 
 
 3) Increase in Donor Base - We hope to add new local donors to the area who will help us continue the program in perpetuity and hopefully arrange to bring 3 maybe 4 artists to the area per year. As it is now, 2 is about all we can handle.
 
 
 
 4) Traditional Media - Every event we have held has been covered by some form of media from KCRW to local news to the LA times, and we hope to continue this engagement with a minimum of 10 articles or news segments per artist per year, around 20 unique press engagements per year.
 
 
 
 5) Community Engagement - The true measure of success will come from the artist. If they leave the program feeling like they were able to connect with the LA community through their work and leave inspired to continue their journey and expand their impact, then that will be the ultimate success. We are ultimately doing this to promote them.","Expense Cost Quantity Total Notes

It's creation began when we met a young women from Afghanistan named Shamsia Hassani through our network. We heard stories and saw pictures of a tiny young woman who went out on the streets of Kabul with a ladder and a few paint cans, transforming the rubble and decay of war into dreamscapes with the silhouetted figure of a forlorn woman with no mouth. Shamsia would later tell me that her girl has no mouth because even if she is allowed to speak, she is not allowed to say what she really means on the streets of Afghanistan. She tells me of men stopping her in the street and beating her with hands and sticks, telling her that ""art is against Islam."" But she continues her work unfettered, driven by an internal desire to create that will not be silenced by man, or religion, or act of Congress. This is the true spirit of an artist. This is the true nature of free speech; having the ability to speak your true despite threat of violence, even if everyone else is against you. It is for this reason, we created the Art in Protest program. To give a voice to people like Shamsia who have sacrificed everything for their art. We initially brought Shamsia to our program in Oslo where she did a live demonstration of her work in the public area, and even collaborated on a piece with a punk rock artist from Cuba whose still seemed aggressive compared to the demure and soft-spoken young woman.
 
 But Shamsia shines through her art. Her work speaks for her where she cannot find the words and gives a voice to thousands of other voiceless women in Afghanistan who long for an equal footing in the world. Since that event in Oslo, we have set up multiple exhibitions for her, and one exhibition in particular drew the attention of curators at the Hammer Museum. This let to a 6 week residency with their museum and excellent exposure for her work. We hope to continue this work and to give a platform to the multitude of artists we can access through our activist network. We are simply seeking the funding to do so in a more official manner.","We will not have partner organizations in the program, but we will have partnerships with the individual artists involved in the program.

We intend to host 2 artists per year from various places around the world who are struggling against authoritarianism and other forms of oppression, giving them a platform to tell their stories, and creating a conversation within the LA community about the state of free speech and censorship both in the US and around the world. Through our program, we have already hosted 5 different artists representing North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, China, and Afghanistan in multiple cities in the US and abroad, and have put on well-received exhibitions, but we have always had to do these events on a razor thin budget, and have not been able to give some of these artists the lasting experience they deserve. This project would be rolled out over the course of a year. We have two artists in mind for the inaugural year: Saudi muralist and leader of the ""I Am My Own Guardian"" Movement, Ms. Saffaa, and Syrian digital artist who has turned his trauma from years of war into intense haunting work, Tammam Azzam. Our goal is to help the LA community connect to these brave artists, to hear their stories, and leave with an appreciation for the free speech and culture of art and creativity that permeate Los Angeles, but that are often silenced by regimes around the world. In the case of Ms. Saffaa, we would like to have her create a mural in honor of Manal al-Sharif, a leader in the movement to get Saudi women the right to drive, who will be traveling across the United States meeting with trailblazing women in April.
 
 The program will facilitate a cultural exchange and bring new beauty and voices to a city that welcomes and supports this activity.
 
 Ideally, we would get Ms. Saffaa into LA as soon as possible. We would need to have her set up for about 6 weeks working on her project and then have a large unveiling and program to celebrate her work. LA has such a vibrant history of graffiti and murals, that the exchange of techniques and ideas in this collaboration could be amazing.
 
 The residency of the second artist would most likely begin in October 2019 with an exhibition in November 2019.
 
 Art is the ultimate way to connect that transcends language and culture. Bringing these artists to Los Angeles, will impact people emotionally at first, and then reach them on an intellectual level we they hear their stories and learn about the hardships they faced to express themselves in a free way, something that many take for granted in this country. Sponsoring this program would allow some of the bravest and most talented artists in the world to have the stage and support to showcase their work to an audience that can really help effect change.

The LAPL has enthusiastically endorsed the concept of housing a STEAM Lab Makerspace at Pio Pico Library, based on their satisfaction with 2BCFâ€™s previous Maker workshops held at various libraries for community and staff. Their only caveat is that 2BCF supply 100% of the funds needed to renovate and equip the space and manage the program. 2BCF will obtain this funding through: 1) existing and new foundation support; 2) 2BCF corporate and private donors; 3) outreach to the Library Foundation; and/or 4) existing 2BCF funds. These efforts are already underway.","Los Angeles has a growing ecosystem of makerspaces located throughout Los Angeles County. There are makerspaces in Pasadena, the San Fernando Valley, Huntington Beach, Downtown Los Angeles and South. However, only four out of the twelve makerspaces in LA County offer free training programs and use of their equipment to the public. More often, they require people to pay a daily rate or a monthly membership fee. Some of those requiring payment may offer free but limited workshop hours or introductory classes as a way to encourage people to become members. One of the perennial concerns of makerspaces is their access to an affordable and adequate facility to accommodate their equipment and provide each member with enough working space. Given these constraints, makerspaces feel it is only viable for them to keep their doors open if they charge a membership fee. 
 
 
 
 
 
 In contrast, 2BCF, through its LA Makerspace division, has been the primary vehicle for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and math) education through Making in both the LA City and County Public Library systems since 2014. Taking these workshop activities to the next level by establishing a fully-equipped, free-to-the-public STEAM Lab Makerspace at the Pio Pico Library is a logical extension of these activities, filling a distinct need and demand for space to learn and play in the Central City area.","2BCF uses the pre-then-post survey technique for measuring impact, which allows us to judge whether the curriculum is effective, serves the students' needs, answers their questions, or whether it needs further refinement. Our surveys are designed by science coordinators from the Los Angeles Unified School District. We will design survey questions for the Pio Pico Makerspace program and conduct them at the start and completion of each workshop series. Retention in workshops to series completion, and enrollment in additional workshops, are also valid measures of impact.

Our signature program, STEAM Lab Makerspace, was in our application for LA2050 in both years we applied and although we did not win, we received the first funding for this program from Metabolic Studios as a result of Lauren Bon seeing our request in the LA2050 campaign. STEAM Lab Makerspaces were born from that first $24,000 grant from Ms. Bon and has since been installed in over 140 pre-K-12 schools throughout Los Angeles and Orange Counties, over half of them in low-income Title I schools, all of which have been funded by corporate and private foundations. 2BCF is confident the Pio Pico Library STEAM Lab Makerspace will receive similar receptivity and has two proposals pending already with local funders.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","2BCF is expanding its signature program, STEAM Lab Makerspace (SLM), from preK-12 schools to LA City and County public libraries.

Its predecessor, T4T.org, was founded in 2004 by manufacturers who recognized that leftover materials from their manufacturing company offered creative learning experiences at their son's preschool. Through a contract with the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), T4T.org provided classroom arts programming, using materials from a variety of manufacturing operations. Over the years, the T4T warehouse evolved from a simple ""market"" into a hub of teacher/student/parent creative interaction as T4T continued to develop educational programs with the help of prestigious partners such as NASA to address emerging classroom needs in science and technology. In 2015, T4T.orgâ€™s Resource Cart was transformed into what is today 2BCFâ€™s signature program, the STEAM Lab Makerspace. A second transformative change occurred when Brent Bushnell, Co-Founder and CEO of Two Bit Circus, invited T4T to participate in the first STEAM Carnivals in San Pedro and San Francisco. Following the STEAM Carnival, Mr. Bushnell joined the T4T.org Board. In 2017, Two Bit Circus formed the Two Bit Circus Foundation which merged with T4T.org under T4Tâ€™s EIN, propelling the new organization into an aggressive new growth phase. Today, 2BCFâ€™s STEAM Lab Makerspace can be found in schools throughout So. CA, Fresno, and Tennessee with an eye to the rest of the country. STEAM Carnivals are thriving locally with three years in Compton and two years in Hawthorne. Dallas/Fort Worth is planning year four and our first International SC was held in Perth, Australia in 2018.

 With no library Makerspaces available in either the City or County public library system, 2BCF proposes to launch the first dedicated Makerspace in a Los Angeles City public library at the Pio Pico Koreatown Library. With support from LA2050, over 6 months, 3,000 sq. ft. of space would be built out, furnished, equipped with 3D printers, and supplied with 2BCF recycled materials. The Workshop schedule would include such topics as: Open Making Hours, Coding in Minecraft, Intro to Coding for Adults, Circuit Bending Music, Little Makers (2-4 year olds), and Citizen Science. Program effectiveness will be measured by pre-then-post surveys conducted at every workshop series.
 
 
 
 Pio Pico Library is located in Koreatown, fifteen minutes from downtown Los Angeles and near the Koreatown/Western Station metro stop. Its population is 53.5% Latino, with a median household income 45% lower than the city's. The library is surrounded by numerous public and private elementary, middle and high schools. 
 
 
 
 2BCFâ€™s Makerspace division has offered free, family-friendly maker workshops to the public at various Los Angeles Public Library branches since 2014, while training library staff to develop and execute their own maker events.
 
 
 
 Pio Pico's free family Makerspace will support intergenerational and diverse learners, giving multicultural families a welcoming, safe space to explore new technologies and develop their skills and projects. With support of experienced Makers, users will develop important â€œsoft skillsâ€ that are key to success in the workplace and entrepreneurship, as well as daily life. Opening access to advanced technologies will encourage users to develop badly-needed STEAM workforce skills and pursue entrepreneurial goals. 
 
 
 
 The Pio Pico Makerspace will: 1) introduce adults to technology in a self-empowering atmosphere with real-world relevance; 2) provide opportunities for students in underserved schools to enhance their creative and critical thinking skills outside of the classroom; and, 3) in the most ethnically diverse city in the nation, allow residents of varied backgrounds to have multi-cultural conversations, fostering understanding on more contentious city-wide issues.

We use augmented reality landscape viewers to give people a new perspective of what's around them.,"Physically manufacturing durable units has been an ongoing challenge for the project, however we're fortunate to be deeply engaged in the LA manufacturing and maker ecosystem. In general, we've found that the best way to overcome the challenges we're facing is to ask for help from those that are more experienced than us. 
 
 
 
 Currently, Perceptoscope founder Ben Sax is a Make it in LA Catalyst Fellow, and also beginning to receive advising from California Manufacturing Technology Consulting. We'll continue to tap into the broader local community to find solutions to the challenges we face.","Many large technology companies have been exploring ways to bring augmented reality to the masses, however most of their approaches are ""consumer-electronics"" focused. They want you to download an app on your phone or purchase an expensive headset. This poses a significant accessibility issue to people who do not have access to the latest technologies.
 
 
 
 We believe that this emerging immersive medium will best take the form of a public service, much like public television or public radio. It's a trusted way to let a place speak for itself to those visiting. 
 
 
 
 Additionally, by inverting the model away from personal ownership of a device, we're able to provide augmented reality to a large number of people with little to no cost. We're looking to eliminate the friction around emerging mediums, and give people access to these new experiences in a more equitable way.","Success for Perceptoscope is ultimately measured in our ability to impact a place. We want to increase visitation to our most beloved public spaces, give people new insight into the world around them, and create a sustainable model for these type of stories to continue to be told there.
 
 
 
 Understanding our physical impact on a place will happen through usage statistics and pedestrian counting. We hypothesize that Perceptoscope will increase the ""stickiness"" of a place, drawing in more people and keeping them there longer.
 
 
 
 Qualitative insights on what people learned through the experiences will come through surveys and user interviews. We want to understand how to make Perceptoscope easy to use and an effective tool for conveying information.
 
 
 
 Sustainability will be measured through revenue potential. We're experimenting with a social enterprise model that allows for users to make contributions to the project as they interact with it, similar to a traditional coin operated binocular. This revenue is both shared with our partner organization, and fed back into the project to create richer experiences and increase our footprint.","Funding will mainly be focused on content development and production costs. Much of this content and software developed will be designed in such a way that partner organizations have effective and inexpensive templates to build upon.

How could we create a portal to a new perspective on the world around us? Early experiments were more like that of a mad scientist than formal technology development.
 
 
 
 Though we've put in a lot of personal effort and sacrifice to get to this point, what really accelerated our growth was when we started sharing the project more broadly across the community. 
 
 
 
 We wouldn't have gotten where we are today without the help of the non-profit makerspace CRASH Space, and by extension the greater Los Angeles Maker community. LA has an incredible base knowledge around making things, spanning the creative media industries, to aerospace, and textiles. If you want to create something entirely new, chances are someone in LA knows how to help you do it.
 
 
 
 By opening up and sharing the project, we were able to build a community of support that could incubate and grow the idea into something bigger. What started off as a prototype built out of cardboard and spare parts become a real product with a Bill of Materials, design specifications, and local contract manufacturers. Each new prototype became a step in a larger journey to understand what it means to make something locally in an increasingly globalized world.

 Our target demographics are the everyday visitors of public spaces around LA. We've had good responses to our deployments from people of all ages, but have found that our greatest enthusiasm comes from kids. In general, we'll be focused on locations where families tend to congregate, like parks and museums.
 
 
 
 As we prepare for deployments, we'll conduct temporary playtesting to try out new ideas and get valuable user feedback. Over longer deployments, we'll be collecting usage statistics and surveys to best understand the ways in which a Perceptoscope deployment impacted that spot over time. This results of this research will be compiled into our final report for National Science Foundation.
 
 
 
 Pilot deployments will begin later this summer, and grow throughout the year as we build more units and develop more experiences. 
 
 
 
 LA is already the best place to CREATE in the world. It's a city where dreamers all kinds come together to craft our shared future. LA's unique nexus of media production and physical manufacturing has also allowed for Perceptoscope to be a project that is of, for, and by Los Angeles.

The needed funding goes into assisting our users in being able to keep track of their jobs, having some GPS capabilities so they can determine the distance away the open position is away from them. Also for my team we need to be able to track everything and properly on-board users and companies.

QuiqWork offers a debt-free approach to career development. Instead of quitting a job to go to school or to get an internship, people can work two part- time jobs to obtain the desired skills. Working two part- time jobs at two different companies allows professionals not to worry about the stress of job change and loss because their benefits are taken care of through QuiqWork.

Another measure is the amount of users that are using the platform and working. If 1,000 users are working through the help of QuiqWork we know that they are working and benefits are covered.","$ 50,000 or less will be allocated toward the platform.- Some of the features will be profile creation, on-boarding capabilities, data collection, applied jobs in users profile cart, job board, front end design, and mobile alerts.

There are three groups that I strongly feel QuiqWork can help. First there is the professional without the college degree like my brother. Hardworking but companies and society never truly accept these individuals into the professional work force, leaving a lack of confidence and low wages. There is the college graduate who has worked in one industry for 5 plus years and has moved up to a mid-level role, like my sister. If this individual wants to try another career path, he or she will likely be denied due to insufficient skills for the mid-level position (underqualified for lateral move to new career), while recruiters will also not hire him/her at an entry level position (overqualified for entry level position in new field). The only option left for this individual is to pursue further education or training, such as through graduate school, while taking time off from the labor force and often accruing thousands more in debt. And last there is the contract worker like a few friends of mine that are presented with high salaries and flexibility only to really result in non-emotionally invested workers that are mostly in search of full-time employment that offers stability and benefits. I believe my platform can give all three groups interesting opportunities in career development/ opportunity and protect them through the coming years of economic crisis and job loss. QuiqWork takes care of stability for all three through offering benefits and opportunities multiply industries.
 
 
 
 The future presents a looming economic crisis and the rise automation that will replace millions of jobs. This will affect the citizens of Los Angeles. I believe our platform is set up to take care and enhance the lives and careers of our users.

 1. We have been executing by first spending months just volunteering in parts of the Los Angeles community through high schools and local Organizations with the focus on career development. Our first plan of action is to assist non college graduates and recently released incarcerated people in finding jobs and providing them health benefits.
 
 
 
 2. Our focus as of now has been in lower income areas. Mostly focus on seniors in high school that are deciding not to go to college and recently released incarcerated people. LAUSD has a graduation rate of around 77% and 81.3 for Los Angeles county. Through research and talking to administrators there is no real accurate way as of now to understand the percentage of those students who graduate from college. To us, there is a very large group of this population, especially in the lower income areas that are not completing college. For the incarcerated data is over two-thirds will be rearrested within 3 years and 60% of formerly incarcerated people are not employed after being release a year.
 
 
 
 3.Our timeline started in November of 2018 to just volunteer in anyway we could. As we approach June ( high school graduation) we plan to have enrollment onto our platform to then start assisting these young professionals in finding jobs that will enhance their skill-set and network.
 
 
 
 4. I believe what we are creating will show positive signs in the three metrics we think we most affect. Graduations rates will increase when students know that not going to college is the only way to be successful. Its highly encourage but letting students know that they can be successful still will help with the gradation rates. Focusing on recently graduated professionals on getting jobs and staying employed will help keep from not exceeding the goal of 7.5% unemployment. For student education pipeline we feel we can set the standard. By the pairing of the jobs allows the young professional to learn two different skills-sets. Just by working allows for them to learn.",,,,Active,LEARN,In Progress,,Application Stage,

5599649533,Green Girl Farms,"Green Girl Farms grows produce in empty spaces and distributes it to the community through donations and produce stands. We build viable, environmentally sound, socially just community food systems.","A barrier we face is the fact that our projected project area is truly a forgotten piece of land. It does not have a parcel number, it has geographical irregularities that prohibit installing traditional walkways or buildings, and it is very near, but not a part of, many city improvement initiatives such as the Port of Los Angeles Master Plan and the San Pedro Business Improvement District. This is not just a challenge but also an opportunity to do something out of the ordinary. We are working with the San Pedro Historical Society, the leaseholder of the property, to revitalize the space and engage with the San Pedro Business Improvement District, the Port, the City of Los Angeles and the residents of the surrounding neighborhood to ensure that public orchard will be a welcome addition to the neighborhood long before we ever plant a tree. The support for the fruit forest is also an opportunity for us to seek a Great Streets Challenge grant to investigate possible streetscape improvements such as connecting bike lanes, installing crosswalks and sidewalks, and connecting to other city initiatives that will further improve the neighborhood.
 
 
 
 Our strategy has been to approach every stakeholder in the community and ask how we can include their priorities for neighborhood betterment in our plan to create a public orchard. It is a strategy that has opened our eyes to problems we did not know existed, and has educated us on the incredible projects others are working to achieve. By prioritizing common goals and values among people and organizations in our neighborhood, we intend to continue to strengthen the project while gathering support.","In Los Angeles, there are several organizations that are dedicated to improving access to locally grown food and educating the public on how to grow food. Enrich LA is one dedicated to creating and maintaining school gardens. Tree People are dedicated to creating more tree canopy in Los Angeles. Food Forward is dedicated to reducing food waste by gleaning fruit trees and distributing the food to those who need it. These efforts are complementary to our own work. Los Angeles is a huge city and county. Most of these organizations do not operate in our area, or have done one-off projects in our community and moved on. Green Girl Farms is one of the best known organizations in San Pedro, and all current projects are thriving and beloved.
 
 
 
 We are focused on creating long-term change in our area through multiple projects and collaborations that address different aspects of our communityâ€™s needs. The public orchard project will encompass several goals: access to locally grown food, increased self sufficiency average, and increased tree canopy cover. We intend to educate the public on how to supplement groceries with hand picked fruits and vegetables from their own neighborhood in order to increase the self sufficiency average in San Pedro. We will continue to extend our partnerships to ensure the success of this project. We intend to partner with WIC, our local public schools, and other groups seeking to assist those with food insecurity to make sure those who need access to healthy food the most take full advantage of the public orchard and other Green Girl Farms fresh food opportunities. We also seek to activate the community in the planting and maintenance of the tree canopy cover. Green Girl Farms is the only organization committed to bringing this variety of people and opportunities together in San Pedro.","Success of our project will be defined by public participation and measured in food distribution and consumption, as well as through goal metrics. In our community engagement phase, we will identify and collate the needs of the community in order to inform our project physical plan and design. As the project moves forward, we will measure participation in the community by engagement in events and build days. Further on in the process, an activated volunteer team will be responsible for the projectâ€™s continued success and measurements. This will include measuring number of visitors and volunteers, tracking fruit harvest in weight and distribution, and tracking outreach strategies including website visits, newsletter opens, and social media engagement data. As well, the public orchard will continue to grow its collaborative partnerships to include other like-minded organizations and continue fundraising efforts to ensure long-term sustainability. There are currently no trees at our chosen location, and we estimate to add about twenty to the tree canopy of our neighborhood. By normalizing fruit picking we hope to increase our residentâ€™s self sufficiency rating substantially while measurably increasing access to healthy food.","PROJECT STAFF & SERVICES (sub-total = $71,000)

Unfazed by these obstacles, she started her own system. Lara began a container garden at a local preschool and and planted food in her sidewalk parkway. Soon she was filling containers with edibles anywhere she could get permission. In one garden, Lara heard a little girl squeal with delight. She had just tasted something but didn't know what it was. Lara explained that it was a yellow cherry tomato. The girl didn't know tomatoes could be that size or color. Lara knew her hobby had become impactful and important work. She realized growing food and working with nature is empowering for everyone, and that the entire community longs for more opportunities to do so. She dedicated herself to gardening for the community while educating herself. She became a Certified Master Gardener in 2012, and founded Green Girl Farms in 2014. 
 
 Today, Green Girl Farms has increased our communityâ€™s ability to interact with growing food and cultivates the freshest possible produce at a socially equitable and affordable price. The organization has created stand-alone edible gardens in public spaces that collectively and annually draw in over ten thousand visitors, produce over five thousand pounds of sustainably grown produce that is distributed in our community, and diverts over three thousand pounds of food waste from landfills that is instead turned into compost that continues to nourish the gardens. Each of these projects has created a tremendous impact in our community. People are thankful to have a green space designed to be consumed, and surprised and delighted by the freshness and flavor of the food grown at Green Girl Farms. As Lara maintains her constellation of project gardens that were once empty lots or unused space, she is constantly reminded by the community what an impact she has made. Parents and teachers use her farm as a classroom. Local restaurants are thrilled to have a farm to table option. Volunteers help keep the farm running and take home fresh vegetables to feed their families. Lara Hughey saw a need in her community, and grew it into an opportunity for everyone.","We will be working with several collaborative partners to bring the fruit forest, a public orchard, to our community. These include but are not limited to, local nonprofits, religious organizations, businesses, and schools. 
 
 
 
 The San Pedro Historical Society is an integral partner as the leaseholder of the proposed project property, adjacent to their historical museum, the Muller House. They will work with our organization to ensure that the proposed public orchard is a seamless addition to the property. San Pedro has a diverse immigrant community. Our residents are families from all over the world who brought trees with them to plant when they moved to America. The knowledge of this rich history will make them essential collaborators as we choose the most historically relevant fruit bearing trees to represent our community. We will also work with the San Pedro Historical Society on logistical details such as lease agreement, securing a water meter for the proposed project, physical project plan details, and outreach events.
 
  
 
 Our other partner organizations such as Feed & Be Fed and The Garden Church have pledged resources such as event and meeting space, as well as extending our outreach and fundraising opportunities to their audiences. Feed & Be Fed will provide input and feedback on the creation of a stand-alone community maintenance team for the project, a system they currently and successfully use to run their community farm.

In a place where so much food grows on trees, education about cultivation and gleaning is paramount to alleviating issues of food waste and food insecurity. We will identify barriers to fresh produce and educate residents about food gathering opportunities available through Green Girl Farms programs. Participation in the cultivation and harvest of fruit trees in our neighborhood will not only improve our tree canopy cover by upwards of 20 trees, but will make a measurable increase in our self sufficiency rating.

 On the Road provides the space for underrepresented Angelenos to create stories that capture the broad of stories of our county and thus sharing their stories with the broader community and inspiring others to create content that reflects the diversity of LA. This activation directly invites members of the community to create the signature art form of LA.",,,Active,CREATE,,,Voting Period,
5793661926,The Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's,The Youth Movement Against Alzheimerâ€™s (YMAA) mission is to promote understanding of Alzheimer's among youth and young adults by providing opportunities to help those affected by the disease.,"During all of our pitch competitions, weâ€™ve had several judges question student interest in such a program. We have focused our marketing efforts and strategy to best reach students, and it seems our efforts have paid off. In just the few two weeks of launching our program, we had 40 students apply. 
 
 Another barrier to success involves attracting caregiver clients. Even though we had several referral partners for our program, we were only able to serve six caregiver at our community-based venue this past year. In parallel, we did 122 one-on-one surveys with family caregivers near USC last year. Through these surveys, we surmised that caregivers of this socioeconomic status struggled to transport their PWDs to our site. For this reason, we are transitioning our model to serve family caregivers in-home, rather than at a community-based venue. This transition also serves to address issues of cultural stigma that communities of color face in seeking caregiving help and lowers our operating cost for the program. 
 
 A final barrier to success is management of liability of students in the homes of PWDs. For this reason, we are working with professors at both UCLA and USC to develop or license a training that is more robust to prepare students for providing respite care in homes. In addition, we are funding student background checks and expanding our liability coverage to mitigate these concerns for family caregivers and future partner universities, respectively. 
 
 Having completed a grant-funded pilot, TimeOut@UCLA, for two years and venue-based YouthCare for one year, we believe we have identified our core barriers to success. An in-home social enterprise is anticipated to be radically more successful.","YouthCare will compete with in-home care services. Our program is unique because of its affordability, its intergenerational interactions, and its memory care component. 
 
 YouthCare allows seniors to engage in cognitively-stimulating activities with a younger generation at an affordable $10/hour -- a cost nearly half of our competitors. We will only charge caregivers at the termination of using this grant funding from LA2050. YouthCare also pairs students and seniors with similar interests, fostering a mentor-mentee relationship that not only decreases the risk of social isolation, but also increases interest among students and creates opportunities for workforce development.","Youthcareâ€™s success will be defined by its ability to reach its ultimate health objective by first reaching its immediate and intermediate objectives. 
 
 
 
 Health Objective: To decrease the prevalence of depression in caregivers of PWDs in Los Angeles who use this program by 10 percent within 9 months of program implementation.
 
 
 
 Intermediate/Behavioral Objectives:
 
 To increase efforts to seek mental health services by family caregivers of PWDs in Los Angeles who use this program by 15 percent within 6 months of program implementation.
 
 To increase use of stress management strategies by family caregivers of PWDs in Los Angeles who use this program by 15 percent within 6 months of program implementation.
 
 
 
 Immediate Objectives:
 
 To decrease internalized stigma about using mental health services in family caregivers of PWDs in Los Angeles who use this program by 25 percent within 3 months of program implementation.
 
 To increase awareness of mental health services in the community for family caregivers of PWDs in Los Angeles who use this program by 95 percent within 2 months of program implementation.
 
 
 
 
 
 The primary evaluation of the programâ€™s outcomes, for family caregivers, will be conducted through a quasi-experimental study design. A non-experimental group of family caregivers will be formed by family caregivers that expressed interest in YouthCare, but did not go on to get matched with a student. These individuals will be paid a small recruitment reward for filling out a survey. The experimental group will be required to answer the survey in order to participate in YouthCare. The survey will include a patient health questionnaire mood scale (PHQ-9) to evaluate symptoms of depression. The survey will further contain questions regarding the use of stress management techniques, use of mental health services, socioeconomic status, race, gender, and qualitative questions to gather more information on the lifestyle of the caregiver. This survey will effectively measure immediate, intermediate, behavioral, and health objectives and will be administered before family caregivers start YouthCare, at the end of the first semester (4 months), and at the end of the second semester (9 months). The counterfactual group will be given the survey at the same time points.
 
 A secondary evaluation will be conducted in tandem for students participating in YouthCare, using a single group pretest-posttest design. This secondary evaluation will assess student satisfaction with YouthCare and student interest in working with older adults. This survey will include qualitative questions to assess the efficacy of the training module and will allow students to reflect on highly positive or negative moments during the course of their volunteering. All data will be coded into SPSS and evaluated using nonparametric statistical tests, given the low n-value. 
 
 
 
 Reduced rates of caregiver stress and depression mean that these caregivers should be able to keep their PWDs at home longer, offsetting costs of expensive assisted living facilities and nursing homes. Eventually, our team plans to work with insurance specialists to gather a research team that can effectively project cost savings of our program on Medicaid and MediCal. If our program reaches 17% of Angelenos who have dementia and allows them to stay at home for an additional two months, we will save the local healthcare system over 1 billion dollars.","Amount

 Total Grant Funding",No additional funding is needed in order to operate YouthCare for two years. Long term sustainability of our program is anticipated to be achieved by seeking reimbursement from healthcare insurance companies.,"['Access to LA2050 community', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","YouthCare is an intergenerational respite and memory care program. For three hours, twice a week, student-senior pairs play games, participate in artistic activities, and deliver the research-backed Brain Boot Camp to help address cognitive decline. Our program aims to help family caregivers reduce stress, address social isolation for persons with dementia (PWDs), and prepare students for careers in aging.","['Central LA', 'East LA', 'Will be county-wide eventually']",Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"My grandmother asked me, â€œRohin, ella vunnavu nana?â€ which simply means, â€œHow are you, Rohin?â€ in my mother tongue, Telugu. This is a common enough question, except my name isn't Rohin.
 
  
 
 My name is Nihal Satyadev, and I am the CEO & Co-Founder of The Youth Movement Against Alzheimerâ€™s (YMAA). We are an army of young people dedicated to helping caregivers for those with dementia. Ten years ago, my grandmother, once a prominent ophthalmologist, began to lose her memory. The roles of mother and children were reversed â€” as my family now had to feed her, bathe her, organize her medications, manage her finances, and be her constant companion. 
 
  
 
 My family is not alone. There are currently 5.5 million Americans diagnosed with dementia, and for each of which there is another unpaid family caregiver diagnosed with depression. These numbers will double in the next 12 years. This growth in rates of Alzheimerâ€™s will bankrupt our healthcare system.
 
 
 
 I heard about these statistics 4 years ago as a public policy intern for Alzheimerâ€™s Association. I was shocked to learn that my peers, who were championing issues of gun reform, student hunger, and income inequality, did not realize that this one disease could make healthcare access impossible for millions of Americans. More shockingly, there was no national organization to mobilize students to address this issue.
 
 
 
 Just months later, YMAA was born. My mission was to rally students to source solutions to address the public health crisis of our generation. In a few years, we grew to actively engaging over 500 students, each with their own connection to the disease. Charlene, a high school senior in East LA, serves as the caregiver for her single mom with early-onset Alzheimerâ€™s. With no other organization serving as a community of young people affected by this disease, we are a family away from family for students like Charlene.
 
 
 
 This past October, I was in a closed-door discussion with leaders from the World Bank, Alzheimerâ€™s Drug Discovery Fund, and several other international leaders working on addressing this disease. YMAA was the only organization working on caregiving innovation. Until there is a cure, we are the best hope for families affected by this disease.","Our major partners are currently:

We learned that our model should transition to serve families in their homes to reach more family caregivers. In order to implement this program in homes, the most critical factors our team will need to address are liability concerns, effectively training students to provide in-home respite care, generating more family caregiver referrals, and executing a strategy for sustaining the program beyond the time-period of this grant. 
 
 Our insurance policy will be restructured to expand coverage into the homes of PWDs. We will license both in-person and online training from UCLA Health. The training will be far more robust than the current training as to ensure that students are able to manage care situations that are unique to in-home settings. In order to generate more family caregiver referrals, YMAA will implement a marketing campaign that will involve signage in various locations across service planning areas (SPAs) four and six, radio advertisements, and flyers distributed at faith-based institutions. This marketing campaign will be critical in generating referrals outside of the healthcare system and dementia care network. To ensure, our programâ€™s long-term sustainability we will work with administration at USC to establish course credit through USC Gero 591, which requires students to participate in a real-world practicum and work with older adults.
 
 Finally, we will transport students using Uber Health and develop materials to inform family caregivers of stress management techniques, the importance of self-care, and resources in their area to seek mental health support, such as caregiver support groups.
 
 B: The proposed program will maintain a target population of unpaid family caregivers in SPAs four and six of LA County who are currently caring for a PWD and cannot afford respite care services. This population is in high need of our service and is proximally located to USC, the source of our students volunteers.
 
 C: April 2019: Restructure insurance policy and begin discussions about student training modules. May 2019: Develop materials for marketing campaign. June 2019: Start marketing campaign in SPAs 4 and 6 (continuous until the end of the timeline). July 2019: Finalize training licensing agreements.

5940181958,VoteRunLead,"VoteRunLead trains diverse women to unleash their political power, run for office, and transform American democracy -- through award-winning programs, online tech, and by inspiring community.","VoteRunLeadâ€™s most pressing challenges are as follows:
 
 - Keeping up with demand. VoteRunLead is excited about numerous of women raising their hands to lead, especially in LA. We are eager to help them step into their full potential! With this demand, we must scale quickly, staffing up and developing online tools to ensure full participation. Fortunately, resources from new and unexpected places allow us to be nimble and responsive; and
 
 - Directing and opening the conversation, even with a brisk pace of growth. VoteRunLead is constantly pushing for womenâ€™s leadership to be a nonpartisan issue. We understand that together, women will bring a unique perspective to decision-making tables, inherently prioritizing and normalizing issues that women value, such as education, human trafficking, womenâ€™s rights, and protection of vulnerable populations. We are excited to maintain this perspective in a highly politicized environment.
 
 - Spreading the word! We were so honored to be a finalist in the LA2050 Activation Challenge last year and, amid the company of so many amazing organizations, we didn't get the social media votes to ultimately win the challenge. So, we've spent last year focused on building a community in L.A.! We are excited to have more supporters in L.A. now than ever before. We look forward to helping L.A. become a leader in voting rates, civic participation, and an innovator in how government and the people communicate.","VoteRunLead is the largest and most diverse nonpartisan organization training women to lead, and we are the only national how-to organization with proven curriculum and tech tools.
 
 Organizations similar to VoteRunLead include:
 
 - Emilyâ€™s List, which offers financial support as a partisan PAC. VoteRunLead is specifically nonpartisan and trains women who are emerging and mid- level leaders. Additionally, VoteRunLead trains at least twice the number of women annually that Emily's List does; 
 
 - She Should Run, which has primary role to recruit women. They are also a nonpartisan organization, but VoteRunLead operates on a much larger scale;
 
 - Run for Something endorses and supports campaigns financially. VoteRunLead does not give financial support to candidates; and
 
 - Emerge is the most direct training competitor, but is partisan and trains about half the women that VoteRunLead trains. 
 
 
 
 VoteRunLead also creates a ladder of engagement, supporting alumna with further resources and networks.","Measuring success through the following goals and outcomes, VoteRunLead will:
 
 VoteRunLead aims to tap into the potential of women in LA, across party lines, who are motivated to and ready to lead. In one year, we aim to:
 
 - Train 200 women in LA through in-person trainings and workshops;
 
 - Reach 1,200 women in LA through online experiences;
 
 - Propel at least 20 women to run for office in their communities, whether through elections on the school board, city council, etc. and through appointed positions;
 
 - Provide at least 1,400 LA women an online, interactive community of support, encouragement, and continued education that will help them move forward on their leadership journey; 
 
 - Activate all women to step into their unique leadership roles in their communities, joining the ranks of motivated citizens who connect and improve their city and county; and
 
 - Propel women into public leadership so that representation reflects the actual population (currently, 51 percent of the U.S. is women; about 40 percent are women of color, but approximately 80 percent of government is led by men, and they are overwhelmingly white men).
 
 We believe that our activation crosses over into the LEARN, PLAY, CREATE, and LIVE areas as well. Through VoteRunLead trainings, women are encouraged to articulate what they value and explore how they can realize those values in their communities. Thus, even if an alumna doesn't run for office, she may take it upon herself to become an entrepreneur, engage with her child's school, and/or advocate for green spaces and healthy environments.","VoteRunLead proposes the following budget for this project:
 
 - Office space $9,000
 
 - Event spaces rental $15,000
 
 - Food costs $10,000
 
 - Insurance $10,000
 
 - Equipment $2,500

Online and in-person trainings will empower and motivate them to run for office, connect with elected officials, mobilize their neighbors, speak out on issues, and more. The result of increased women's leadership will be waves of positive change in neighborhoods, across L.A., for all people.",['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)'],Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"VoteRunLead knows that women are inherent leaders. They are CEOs, school board Presidents, mothers, entrepreneurs, and more. Many women easily tap in to the needs of others, which makes them perfect change-makers. We have so many stories to share about how inspiration grows into impact: 
 
 - Our first example is with alum Liuba Grechen Shirley, who is a businesswoman, nonprofit leader, mom, and 2018 candidate for the House of Representatives. VoteRunLead's ""Run As You Are"" message resonated with her and, realizing that the only way she could campaign was if she had regular child care for her two young children, Shirley appealed to the Federal Election Commission to clear funds for this use. With numerous letters of support from elected officials, Shirley became the first person ever to use campaign funds on child care. This is a game-changer for for any candidate with children, including men. 
 
 - Alum and New York State Representative Alicka Ampry-Samuel was raised in Brownsville, one of the most impoverished areas of Brooklyn, NY. Urged by VoteRunLead to be an authentic leader, she is now living a life of public leadership so that she can give back. Running on the slogan ""Hope is Inside,"" Ampry-Samuel ran for office because ""I love my community, I'm a product of my community, and my community deserves for me to run."" In her first few months in office, she has co-sponsored eight bills to improve education, public housing, community development, and neighborhood safety. She is also the lead sponsor of the City Council resolution to expand and renew the speed camera program, which has an immediate impact and reduces speed at intersections in the neighborhood by as much as 63%.
 
 
 
 These two women -- and so many others! -- demonstrate how inspiration leads to impact. We know there's a multitude of women in L.A. waiting to show what amazing leaders they can be, and what positive impacts they can make on our city and county.","VoteRunLead is proud to partner with several organizations that expand our reach, deepen our connections, and ensure that our trainees are a diverse group of women.

 L.A. County is unique in that it is so diverse with a multitude of voices -- yet many of these voices are not always heard in government. The region has a consistently low voter turnout and an L.A. city council that is 77% men. The city has never had a woman mayor. But half our city is comprised of incredible, talented women. Thus, L.A. is an ideal location to connect and engage through civic participation and women's leadership training. 
 
 
 
 VoteRunLead would be honored to help residents connect through our tried-and-true strategies:
 
 - In-Person Trainings and Engagements. Our signature training, called ""Run As You Are,"" is a six-point curriculum covering key ways for women to develop, hone, and execute their public leadership skills. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of our award-winning trainings show that women emerge with greater knowledge and confidence, committed to the path to lead.
 
 - Digital organizing and activism. VoteRunLead's online trainings and workshops provide an opportunity for leaders to learn from anywhere, on their own schedules. Plus, our social media network of nearly 21,000 individuals is active, engaged, and supportive.
 
 - Increasing participation in political processes. VoteRunLead is targeting women to run for office between now and 2020. We are also making a specific call to action to women who have historically been underrepresented: women of color, younger women, women with lower incomes. 
 
 - Advocating for policy. Studies show women are more likely than men to pass a bill and work in a bipartisan manner. Our alumnae pass pay equity bills, bring long-ignored issues to the fore, and advocate for vulnerable populations. Nonpartisan VoteRunLead welcomes women of all backgrounds and beliefs, speaking to all parties and Millennials who often claim no party affiliation.
 
 - VoteRunLead creates new tools and technologies for greater civic/political engagement. As mentioned above, VoteRunLead has an engaged online community and aims to expand online tools.
 
 - Influencing individual behavior. VoteRunLead's message of empowerment and collaboration impacts women not only on a systemic level, but also on an individual one, which opens new doors in their everyday lives.
 
 
 
 Our data shows that our trainings are effective, with an average of 65-70% of our candidates winning their elections, including 70% of *first-time* candidates (statistics show that usually, first- timers win 10% of the time).

For the initial pilot, we will need to rely primarily on anecdotal feedback from teacher and student surveys. As the program progresses, we will be able to collect more quantitative data.","A limited number of middle schools in LAUSD have international education initiatives; however none of these initiatives have the unique benefits of the IVCLA Go Global Classroom.

Each year IVCLA coordinates specialized programs for about 800 IVLP participants from more than 140 countries on topics ranging from entrepreneurship, refugee and immigrant issues, education, environmental issues, womenâ€™s empowerment, and many other critical global issues. IVCLA also has strong relationships with international participants of university exchange programs such the Fulbright Scholarship Program, and with members of the Los Angeles Consular Corps. IVLP participants, international exchange students and members of the Los Angeles Consular Corps will play a key role in the IVCLA Go Global Classroom by participating in classroom visits as Go Global Ambassadors. These visits will offer unique first-hand information and provide exceptional role models for the students. Our 39 years of experience creating intercultural exchanges gives us the expertise to develop an exceptional global education program.","Students will receive preliminary and final questionnaires to assess their attitudes, curiosity and knowledge about global facts, cultures and events. Success will be defined by a change in attitudes, and increased knowledge and curiosity about global facts, cultures and events.

 â€¢ Student preliminary questionnaire to establish a baseline and final questionnaire to assess results of program
 
 â€¢ Student and teacher evaluations to collect qualitative feedback on experiences
 
 â€¢ IVCLA staff person will conduct in-person observation and assessments based on evaluation metrics determined by teachers and a volunteer expert

Another likely challenge is that weâ€™ll be telling the personal stories of many people who may not want to share extensive details about what theyâ€™ve been through or what theyâ€™re now facing.

We'll adjust the plan as needed so that it works well for the program. But here's how we would approach it: 
 
 
 
 BASIC OPERATION
 
 â€¢Â We'll build our team, starting with a lead editor and a reporter at CALmatters in Los Angeles and a reporter at La OpiniÃ³n. We'll also bring in Los Angeles journalism students skilled in multimedia storytelling. 
 
 â€¢Â We'll research each LA2050 initiative to determine the intersections with government and policy areas we cover and assign the reporters to do stories that provide background and understanding of the legislative and regulatory issues related to each initiative's work. The purpose here is to raise awareness of the challenges and help people become more engaged in seeking solutions. Much of this will be done by the reporters on this project, while some will be done by other reporters at CALmatters and La OpiniÃ³n who have specific topic expertise.
 
 â€¢Â We'll assign the student journalists to partner with the initiatives, identify the best ways to do personal storytelling around each one, develop plans for that storytelling and help to make it happen. 
 
 â€¢Â We'll edit and publish all of the content as it becomes available. In addition to publishing it through CALmatters and LaOpiniÃ³n, we can offer it to the LA2050 site and to the groups running the initiatives. We'll also share it with our media partners to increase the reach. 
 
 
 
 POPULATION SERVED
 
 This content will be available to everyone, but it'll be especially useful to at least four groups: The people running the initiatives, the people they're serving, the elected officials who are willing to help address these issues, and the activist Californians who care about these issues and will get involved when they read our stories. While the topics are in Los Angeles County and that's the primary service area, the fact that the content will be available statewide may help draw attention to needed legislative and policy changes. 
 
 
 
 TIMELINE
 
 It will take about four weeks to hire the team and make the initial assignments, and another couple weeks to get the first stories done. So we expect to begin publishing toward the end of the second month and keep up a steady cadence of content through the full year. 
 
 
 
 HOW THIS HELPS L.A. BE THE BEST PLACE TO CONNECT
 
 Our work will build connections by telling the stories of the groups running the initiatives and the people being served. Those stories will help their fellow Angelenos understand them and find ways to connect with them. Those connections can in turn lead to everything from increased financial support to volunteers, resources, jobs for clients and much more. We also hope this effort leads Angelenos to connect and unite over their shared desire to play a more active civic role in their governance, which in turn makes for a stronger democracy.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,

Our strategies for overcoming these are to make the curriculum easy for anyone to lead and as flexible as possible. Each Fit Kids class is designed to last 60 minutes but these can be easily broken up into smaller units as needed. Another potential challenge is inclement weather. While Fit Kids is primarily an outdoor curriculum, we regularly advise Partners on how to modify it for use indoors. They have found this very helpful. The 2019-2020 curriculum will include a â€œRainy Dayâ€ tab, which will list specific exercises and activities that are just as effective when done indoors, even in a space as small as a classroom.","Fit Kidsâ€™ mission overlaps to a large degree with that of an organization like Playworks, which is an older, larger, national organization that provides a broad range of consulting services to help incorporate more play into school life. Some of these â€œplayâ€ opportunities are highly physical and may resemble a Fit Kids class. Others are more imaginative. Like Fit Kids, their programs engage children in both physical activity and social-emotional learning. Their basic approach is to work with a school to develop its own programming, informed by Playworks insights and best practices. 
 
 
 
 What distinguishes Fit Kids and makes it special is its strong fitness focus and its accessibility.

The initial goal was to bring sports programs to low-income communities. We quickly found that the young people with whom we were working lacked the coordination, speed, strength and agility that are essential for playing sports. Unlike their peers in neighboring higher-income communities, these children did not have safe parks to play in, meaningful physical education programs in school or organized after-school sports to help them develop fundamental movement skills.
 
 
 
 To address this alarming opportunity gap and empower children to adopt a physically active lifestyle, Fit Kids began offering free after-school fitness programs in underserved communities. Over the last seven years, we have continuously improved upon a year-long physical activity program that we make available, at no cost, to schools and community organizations serving low-income households. 
 
 
 
 Our Director of Programs, Navita Wilson, vividly describes the stresses felt by families caught between steadily rising housing costs and low-wage jobs: â€œStudents are having to move in with cousins or other families. Theyâ€™re being doubled and tripled and maybe even quadrupled up in a home, sometimes with people they donâ€™t even know.

Fit Kids will help make LA the best place to play by bringing an innovative, structured physical activity curriculum to afterschool programs serving disadvantaged Angelenos aged 5 to 13. Fit Kids was born in the Bay Area and expanded to Los Angeles in 2017. We now have 15 LA programs serving 3800 kids and a growing wait list. An investment by My LA 2050 would more than triple the number of programs, to 47, in 2019-2020 and set the stage for continued growth.
 
 
 
 Physical activity is essential to every childâ€™s healthy development but, for lack of access and opportunity, children in lower-income communities are more likely to be physically inactive, overweight or obese, which can lead to a lifetime of health problems. For these children, we must provide equitable access to structured programs that motivate them to stay active by making fitness fun. More funâ€”and more resourcesâ€”will drive higher participation in afterschool services. The earlier and more consistently we can offer them these opportunities, the better. 
 
 
 
 Fit Kids provides everything that under-resourced schools and nonprofit organizations need to implement a professionally-designed fitness program with their existing staff. This includes all required equipment, the latest curriculum in digital and hard copy, in-person training, as well as support from Fit Kidsâ€™ Director of Programs. The curriculum includes a total of fifty classes, broken into five units: Team Building, Communication, Locomotor Skills, Chasing/Fleeing and Hand/Eye Coordination. Over the course of the year, there are five fitness areas that are repeated and get progressively more difficult: Push/Pull Muscles, Core, Agility, Balance and Power. All activities build fitness and motor skills and encourage communication, teamwork and other social-emotional skill building. 
 
 
 
 Schools and afterschool programs qualify to receive Fit Kids based on the percentage of their students who are eligible for free and reduced-price school meals. The minimum is 50% eligible but the average Fit Kids Partner Site is closer to 90%. This school year, more than 10,000 children are thriving in Fit Kids classes every week, in the Bay Area, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. 
 
 
 
 The annual program timeline begins over the summer, when site lists and curriculum updates are finalized and equipment is ordered. Site coordinators are trained in August and classes begin with the school year in August/September. The Director of Programs conducts in-person site visits in November and February. Partner Sites report on participation and progress every month and Fit Kids supports them as needed throughout the year.

6064284584,California Common Cause,The mission of our VCC-Los Angeles collaborative is to support effective implementation of a new voting system in LA County and engage the public throughout the process.,"The major barrier is the scope of this work, given that it is Countywide. In our previous work conducting community meetings with LA County, we noticed the difficulty in drawing out communities from every neighborhood because of the size of our target regions. This demonstrates the importance of holding multiple events in different areas and dedicating additional time to outreach to engage communities that may be more isolated.","Many, if not all, of the organizations already doing this work have partnered with the RR/CC in their current community engagement efforts. Our role moving forward would be to inform a broader range of organizations about the new voting system and collaborate with them on vote center implementation activities. Our collaborative is unique in that our members have worked on vote center implementation in the 5 Voterâ€™s Choice Act counties in 2018. Many of our member organizations have also been long standing partners of LA County and were involved with this new voting system since its conception. Additionally, most of our organizations are headquartered or based here in Los Angeles. The VCC-LA hub brings a combination of deep networks and expertise to the voting system implementation project, and we look forward to partnering with more organizations as we continue this project.","Success for this project would mean:
 
 - An influx of new community-based organizations supporting and/or partnering on the new voting system implementation project. These community-based organizations would be representative of Los Angeles County's demographic and geographic diversity.
 
 - The Mock Election and Demo Centers invited demographically and geographically representative participation.
 
 - A successful rollout of the new voting system with minimal voter confusion and high voter participation and confidence, accessibility, and satisfaction in the system. Our organizations are all involved in operating voter hotlines and poll monitoring programs during elections. Our call volume, feedback from the hotline, and reports from the field will be a strong measure of the success of our outreach campaign.
 
 - Development of information channels trusted by the public, which we will also use to distribute critical information about the 2020 elections. 
 
 - Higher rates of participation in municipal and federal races on the 2020 ballot. 
 
 With broader election participation, election results in the local and federal will be more reflective of the populationâ€™s values. This leads to a more satisfied electorate, who is confident in their political system and more likely to continue showing up to vote.
 
 - As many of our organizations are leading Census 2020 and redistricting work, the partnerships we build in this project will pave the path for strengthened relationships leading into this next cycle of work.","Development of Materials and Translations: $7,000

 2020 is a huge election year for LA County voters with the moving up of the presidential primary date and the implementation of a new voting system. For the first time, many voters will also be voting on a range of races, including who should serve on City Council and who the presidential nominee should be, all on the same ballot. A robust and inclusive voter outreach plan is critical to ensure that the reforms successfully increase voter participation. By connecting with voters about the changes early and promoting broad participation in hands-on learning events, we will ensure that voters are prepared and excited to cast their ballots with a new voting system in 2020.
 
 
 
 LA County RR/CC has planned a Fall 2019 Mock Election and Demo Centers to promote public awareness of the new voting system. This will be the first opportunity for the public to experience the new voting system firsthand before voting in a real election. The first piece of our proposal is to educate voters about the changes and expand voter participation in the Mock Election and Demo Centers. The second piece is to collect feedback from voters on their experiences participating in the Mock Election.
 
 
 
 In June 2019 â€“ September 2019, we will develop education materials including fact sheets and graphics on the changes, including translated materials. These materials will be distributed through online platforms including our central resource hub at voterschoice.org. We will conduct outreach with a focus on engaging organizations that work with language minority groups, low income communities, geographically isolated communities, and voters with disabilities. We will focus on communities who have been traditionally been underrepresented and whose early engagement would improve their voting rates in 2020.
 
 
 
 In September 2019, we will continue our outreach and boost promotion efforts to encourage public participation in the Fall 2019 Mock Election. During this time, we will connect with voters to get their feedback on their experience, including their thoughts on the changes, the location, and the voting process. We will also visit Mock Election sites to observe voters.
 
 
 
 In October 2019 â€“ February 2020, we will continue connecting with voters on their voting experience to compile feedback and document any issues to improve the future voting experience. We will also reach out to Demo Center visitors to hear their feedback.

6067926724,Novelly,"Novelly is on a mission to spark the changemaker in every young person, one young adult novel at a time.","Two major challenges that we have encountered and continue to encounter is resistance to the idea that this approach can work and resistance to the idea that we should be engaging young people in tough topics and complex issues in the first place. First, civic education is primarily delivered in-person through school-based or community-based programming. While there is immense value in this type of programming, not every student in Los Angeles has access to in-person civic education or is aware of in-person civic engagement opportunities around them. We propose that we can first reach young people through online programming, then connect them to existing opportunities with their community. We intend to overcome this resistance by demonstrating the efficacy of our approach throughout the pilot. Second, we often find that adults can be uncomfortable with the idea of young adolescents engaging with topics such as immigration, police brutality, discrimination against the LGBTQ community, and violence against girls and women. However, the reality is that students in Los Angeles are well aware that these issues exist within their community. They are simply not given enough opportunities to engage with these issues on a deeper level and take action. We intend to overcome this resistance through the pilot and using data to demonstrate the demand for such opportunities among young people.","Both Novelly and Generation Citizen (GC) deliver action-oriented civics education to young people that build their collaboration, communication, research, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Over the course of our respective programs, young people recognize and analyze social issues that they care about and take tangible action alongside their peers. We share the same goal of empowering the next generation of active and engaged citizens who have the knowledge, skills, and motivation to shape better societies. GC's model uses teachers and democracy coaches to deliver civics education to students in school settings, while Novelly uses the Novelly app as a civics education tool, which delivered to young people on the internet without gatekeepers. Novelly is also a form of ""stealth education,"" as it uses entertaining media as a starting point to explore issues that young people may or may not strongly relate to. GC, on the other hand, is explicitly educational and focuses on issues from within the students' local communities. 
 
 
 
 Within the reading app space, both Novelly and MyHealthEd operate as educational technology non-profit organizations. We use storytelling and a digital platform to deliver stealth education to teenagers. To do this, MyHealthEdâ€™s mobile app, Real Talk, pairs stories with high-quality, online sexual health resources, while in the Novelly app, resources and learning activities are embedded within the stories. MyHealthEd focuses on health education while Novelly focuses on civic education. However, Novelly will have quite a bit of young adult fiction content focusing on gender equality, which overlaps with MyHealthEdâ€™s work, particularly in violence against girls, women and LGBTQ individuals. While MyHealthEd is building the knowledge of its users, Novelly is focused on building skills and motivations to engage with complex issues and topics. To that end, our product incorporates a highly interactive curriculum and readership community into the learning experience.","We will be piloting the web app with students in schools in libraries during the fall and spring semester of 2019-2020 school year in the Greater Los Angeles Area. By the end of this grant period, we are successful if we achieve the following milestones: (1) pilot the web app with 5,000 adolescents, (2) collect data from the pilot on the efficacy of the web app, (3) refine the web app and integrate new features based on the pilot, and (3) launch the web app so that any young person can access it. We are also successful if the data from the pilot shows that students who use the web app over the course of the semester demonstrate improvements in their skills, knowledge, and motivation as they relate to civic engagement. Based on the UNESCO framework for global citizenship education, we will measure progress in the following global citizenship competencies for students ages 13-15: (1) empathy (2) critical thinking/problem solving (3) ability to communicate and collaborate with others (4) conflict resolution (5) sense of security and identity (6) shared universal values (7) respect for diversity/intercultural understanding and (8) recognition of global and local issues as well as their interconnectedness. User engagement with the app will be measured by the number of daily active users, retention rate, and contribution rate. User engagement with the issue will be measured by the rate at which users: complete the novel, complete embedded learning activities, participate in discussions, engage with partner content, and complete calls to action.","$15K software development (maintenance and debugging during the pilot)

This, combined with spaces for dialogue and action, can spark social change. This is rooted in her undergraduate honors thesis, which found that Wonder by RJ Palacio can generate thoughtful and critical discussions on disability among middle school students in the Greater Los Angeles Area. In her work with schools, she noticed how fiction can make it easier for us as a society to talk about tough topics with young people, giving her immense hope. She wondered how she could find a way to have these conversations with thousands of young people.

It is a pipeline to genuine civic engagement that young people can participate in at their own pace, on their own terms and on their mobile phones and computers. The Novelly app catalyzes the civic engagement process for youth through the following features: 
 
 
 
 *Read a young adult fiction story that touches on a social issue
 
 *Complete embedded learning activities critically engaging with the story from the lens of the issue
 
 *Participate in community discussions
 
 *Respond to calls to action from partners
 
 *Organize in-person with their peers
 
 
 
 Every quarter, the stories and issue themes available on the app will change, ensuring that our young users will always have access to dynamic content and community. 
 
 
 
 First, we will partner with authors, publishers, and other content creators to produce original stories for the Novelly platform or make existing published content temporarily available for that quarter. This content will reflect a diverse range of backgrounds, perspectives, and issues. Second, we will partner with existing non-profit organizations, initiatives, and influencers whose work is related to the quarterly theme to share calls to action, co-create educational content and moderate discussions on the app. 
 
 
 
 By bringing these partners with a vested interest in an issue and in youth together in a single platform, Novelly can create a unique civic education experience for young people. By starting with entertainment, Novelly can first connect social issues to young people's lives and communities, then connect them to a community of peers and opportunities to take action. Through the app, users can do all of this without gatekeepers, daily and over a sustained period of time. 
 
 
 
 Over the course of the 2019-2020 academic year, we will pilot the app with 5,000 young adolescents ages 13 to 15 in Los Angeles County. 
 
 
 
 As young people who grew up in Los Angeles, we remember hanging out at the school library or spending summers in the local library. We remember how books inspired lively and deep conversations when we were kids. We believe that technology can amplify the power of reading to connect young people to each other, their communities and issues that they care about. According to the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, adolescents in California who are civically engaged (have high civic efficacy, are involved in social impact clubs or organizations, and volunteer) are more likely to have better health, better grades and greater motivation to attend college. Beyond the benefits of civic engagement to individual young people, there is the far-reaching and long-term positive impact on the vibrancy of communities.

Although we have been promised that groundbreaking is 3 or more years away (about the same time that our lease expires), the property owner also has the ability to kick us out with 1 year notice. As such, we plan our years on a 12 month schedule and are in the early stages of searching for a permanent home for our project, which we hope to move into in 2022. In the interim, we have developed a network of collaborators and partners who have committed to housing our programs and activities in the event that an early vacancy of our building is required. 
 
 
 
 We know that rising housing costs in the city affect cultural workers, and we have allocated 10% of the LA2050 grant for an emergency housing grant fund to allow our Collective Residents to apply for help in a time of need (to facilitate moving costs, cover shortages in rent, or provide emergency shelter).","While there are many event spaces, galleries, performance spaces, maker labs, production studios, and community centers in Los Angeles, many of which provide excellent services and programs for their constituents, NAVEL attempts to define new possibilities for all of these worlds to be in conversation with one another. We create open and equitable systems to ensure we are listening to the needs of our community and moving in the direction we all wish to go. This flexibility and openness allows us to engage in intentional adaptation, morphing with ease into whatever the community needs from it, today. We welcome collaboration with any organizations doing similar work if together we are able to maximize our shared resources towards a common goal.","While we certainly will measure traditional metrics such as attendance at programs and events, number of residents, members, and volunteers, and demographic information on participants, audiences, employees, and board, there is a certain difficulty in measuring how connected we have helped others to feel via our project. 
 
 
 
 To measure this, we will employ a number of strategies including: designing a survey for audiences and participants to measure connectivity and community strength, analyzing programmatic crossover to see if audiences are branching from their primary community to experiment or learn from another community that is active in the space, and measuring the depth of our partnerships with other local organizations.

Additional projects are sourced from an Open Proposal submission process and ongoing collaborations with partner organizations. 
 
 
 
 ASSEMBLIES is where learning happens together through the exchange of ideas, traditions, and experience. An ASSEMBLY is simply a group that forms around a theme, practice or experiment, proposed by anyone in the community. For 3 months, we provide space, support, and resources towards the completion of a final project, be it a presentation, performance, publication, or object, which we then publish via our digital content channels. Participation is absolutely free.
 
 
 
 Our Collective Residency is where we nurture and support people and ideas while they take root and begin to grow. For a period of 1 to 2 years, over 100 local and international residents have access to our space, equipment, network, and support at no cost. In return, residents actively engage in shaping our mission and activities, diversifying the voices and perspectives represented at NAVEL.
 
 
 
 b.) We support a community of multidisciplinary cultural workers, with a focus on those from historically marginalized communities â€” especially women, queer/trans/non-binary folx, and people of color. Any awarded funds would have an immediate impact on our ability to sustainably execute our core programs while ensuring they remain accessible. 
 
 
 
 c.) The 2019 Public Programming is set and runs from April to November. Our 2020 committee will be elected via an open call and begin to work in October 2019, with a season announcement set for January. 
 
 
 
 ASSEMBLIES runs on a quarterly schedule and is capped by our Quarterly Meeting, where current ASSEMBLIES present their findings and new ASSEMBLIES are proposed. Upcoming Quarterly Meetings are 6/2, 9/8, 12/15.
 
 
 
 Our Collective Residency accepts new residents via an open call in April of each year. Our newest cohort of residents will begin in June 2019. 
 
 
 
 d.) In a city as sprawling as Los Angeles, where feelings of disconnection and loneliness overwhelm us all, NAVEL serves as a central site where all are welcome to connect with one another, in person, through culture. 
 
 
 
 By being collectively-run, we encourage the community to impact the direction that we are headed in, both by electing our programming committee and serving on the board of directors. 
 
 
 
 We encourage volunteerism and other non-monetary forms of exchange (work-trade, skill sharing, etc.) to find novel ways to redistribute resources with one another in equitable ways.

6159893583,9 Dots,"At 9 Dots, we are a community of educators, researchers, and engineers committed to bringing an exceptional computer science to all students, particularly those from underserved communities.","Computer science (CS) is having a deep and rapidly expanding impact throughout the global economic, scientific, social, and civic spheres. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), computing occupations comprise 58% of all projected new jobs in STEM fields in 2016-2026, and CS is the second highest paid college degree (National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2018). Ninety-one percent of parents want their children to learn CS in order to prepare for successful futures (Google-Gallup, 2016). Yet wide scale K-12 CS education has lagged behind the demand, ill-preparing young students to effectively participate in the emerging 21st century workplace and world. 
 
 
 
 In January of 2016, the Computer Science for All initiative recognized computer science (CS) as a â€œnew basicâ€ skill set â€œnecessary for economic opportunity and social mobilityâ€ and has catalyzed concerted efforts to empower all K-12 American students with a CS education. That same year, a comprehensive K-12 Computer Science Framework was released. More recently, in 2018 California released its own CS standards, aligned with that framework, but with school funding sources often tied to standardized test performance in other subjects, it can still be difficult for under-resourced K-6 schools to prioritize CS education. In California, the more low-income and students of color enrolled at a school, the less likely that school is to offer a CS course, and of California schools with the highest percentages of low-income students, 75% do not offer any CS education at all (Martin, McAlear, and Scott, 2015). Over 55% of California Principals report a lack of trained teachers as the greatest barrier to offering CS (Google-Gallup, 2015). 
 
 
 
 9 Dots makes implementing an exceptional CS education as easy and affordable as possible by offering a turnkey solution with intensive services focused on teacher training and support that build the capacity of Los Angeles area schools to provide and sustain CS education in the future. But we also help schools become more aware of how learning to code at the elementary school level develops foundational computational thinking and problem solving skills that support student learning across domains. In tomorrow's world, a lack of these early cognitive skills may be as challenging to these youth in the future as illiteracy is today.","While there are a growing number of CS education for profit and nonprofit services (largely focused on middle and high school), 9 Dotsâ€™ work is unique in three ways: 1) We go beyond the after school or â€œboot campâ€ exposure that many other programs offer and implement coding as a stand-alone course, as part of a fully sequenced K-6 CS education pathway. 2) We focus on supporting teachers. Teachers are the single most important factor in student learning (Rand, 2019) but many online coding programs and curricula are designed for a self-guided student experience, limiting teachersâ€™ roles and the classroom collaboration that supports a joyful and inclusive learning environment. 3) We have developed a unique expertise in serving underrepresented students. Stereotypes about CS ability and a lack of diverse role models creates an early perception for young girls, low-income students, and students of color that they do not belong in a CS class which â€œnegatively affects opportunity, interest, and persistence in early computing education.â€ (Kapor Center, 2018). All our curriculum and lesson plans are required to include strategies that support feelings of belonging and coder identity for all students.","9 Dots defines success for this project as 1) completing K-6 CS education pathways in at least 10 of our partner schools; 2) â€œgraduatingâ€ 100 local teachers as independent and effective coding instructors; and 3) achieving a 90% grade level coding proficiency rate for all students served.
 
 
 
 9 Dots tracks the numbers of students, teachers, and schools that we serve to assess the scale of our impact while gathering quantitative and qualitative data to assess program outcomes. Student proficiency rates are measured through 9 Dotsâ€™ Independent Coding Challenge (ICC). The ICC assessment is administered after the completion of content lessons before students begin to work on classroom projects. It includes up to 12 coding challenges based on the previous lessons, and tagged for both the coding and the problem solving skills required to complete them. 
 
 
 
 9 Dots surveys teachers after every quarterly PDW, using Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) indicators to analyze results on 1) how likely teachers are to recommend our program to a colleague, and 2) how satisfied teachers are with their Coding Coordinator. Educator progress towards independent teaching or â€œgraduationâ€ is assessed collaboratively with teachers and administrators based on a range of indicators including comfort with using tech in the classroomÍ¾ classroom managementÍ¾ and lesson preparedness.","In order to build out a complete CS pathway across all grade levels in at least 10 of our partner schools, 9 Dots will need to recruit, hire, and train up to 6 additional Coding Coordinators for the 2019-20 academic year. Under the leadership of Executive Director Josh Taylor and the direction of our Get Coding Program Lead Maâ€™ayan Weinberg, our Coding Coordinators are enthusiastic recent graduates with a passion for education, CS, and innovation. Many of our Coding Coordinators go on to train and serve as Lead Instructors, Curriculum Developers, or Software Developers with 9 Dots after their classroom service.

Together with our Board of Directors, 9 Dots leverages a diverse base of private and public philanthropic support from dedicated individual, corporate, and foundation funders to cover the remaining costs and provide our program services affordably. In addition to these funding sources, 9 Dots is also the recipient of two National Science Foundation grants for our research initiatives, in partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley): â€œDebugging Failure: Fostering Youth Academic Resilience in Computer Scienceâ€ (2016), and â€œProgramming as a Context for Making Problem Solving Visible: An Equity Focused K5 Research Practice Partnershipâ€ (2018).","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","9 Dots is seeking a $100,000 LA2050 grant to support a high quality K-6 computer science (CS) education for 6500 elementary school students and to provide CS instructional training to over 200 teachers at 25 Title I elementary schools.

She quickly got over her fear of making mistakes and learned to work collaboratively with her peers to find solutions. Carla believes that her experience learning coding and debugging in elementary school has helped her in math, but notes that it has also helped her to gain confidence in herself as she progresses along the path of her education. Now in 7th grade, Carla believes she has many options she might pursue in the future; she is interested in a career in architecture, or in coding, or maybe even at NASA.

Program strategy:
 
 Get Coding provides local Title I elementary schools with everything they need to offer fun and rigorous coding classes that prepare young students for future educational and professional opportunities in STEM and a wide range of other fields. Teachers are central to our strategy. 9 Dots Coding Coordinators work side by side with teachers at all levels of prior CS experience to assist in planning, setting up, and delivering each coding class. Coding Coordinators model best practices in CS instruction, conduct quarterly professional development workshops, and provide office hours for additional CS content knowledge or technical support until every teacher is ready to teach CS independently.
 
 
 
 b. Population served:
 
 Get Coding is currently being implemented in 21 Title 1 K-6 partner Los Angeles (LAUSD) and Compton Unified (CUSD) schools, reaching 5000 students and 186 teachers. Nearly 25% of LAUSD and 36% of CUSD students are English Language Learners, compared to the state average of 21.4%. The average Free and Reduced Price Meal (FRPM) rate across the 21 schools we serve is 88%, and the average student racial demographics are as follows: 14.5% African AmericanÍ¾ .35% American Indian or Alaska NativeÍ¾ 2.4% Asian/Pacific IslanderÍ¾ 76% Hispanic / LatinoÍ¾ 5% White/Caucasian, and 1.75% Other. 47% of students are boys and 53% are girls.
 
 
 
 c. Timeline:
 
 9 Dots will serve an estimated 6500 students and 200 teachers in at least 25 Title I K-6 schools in the 2019-20 school year. Get Coding is structured as a one-hour weekly class, taught over 30 weeks. In addition to supporting teachers and students as they progress through our original coding curriculum, 9 Dots Coding Coordinators work with teachers and school administrators to host community events and showcases that help build a culture of awareness and CS participation for families in Los Angeles low-income communities. 
 
 
 
 With some variance by district and by school, the timeline for the Get Coding program is as follows:

6188981245,Turnaround Arts: California,"Turnaround Arts: California harnesses the power of the arts to engage, empower, and transform high-need schools and communities.","High need schools are faced with community-wide challenges such as, poverty, violence, and food and home insecurity. These factors lead to higher burn out and turn over in the school personnel. Our program recognized this key barrier, and has embraced a robust leadership and professional development model to support our principals and teachers. In addition, school culture and climate is a key focus of our work with each partner school. Studentsâ€™ experience with poverty and trauma can often affect their readiness to learn and confidence in school. Teachers will learn to use the arts to provide new entry points for all students to increase participation, build confidence, and access content knowledge. Each partner school incorporates arts as a tool to encourage and increase family engagement with their schools. Families who previously feel intimidated in school because of low levels of education or fluency in English, respond well to opportunities to celebrate childrenâ€™s creativity through low barrier, interactive arts experiences.","In Los Angeles, there are many arts nonprofit agencies that provide professional learning in the arts for teachers and/or direct arts instruction to young students, such as P.S. Arts, Innerâ€City Arts, Armory Center for the Arts and CoTA (Collabora ons Teachers and Artists). Other education nonprofit agencies whose work is similar to ours include the Children's Defense Fundâ€“California, which engages in policy advocacy, research, coalitionâ€building, and youth organizing to fight for educa on policies that benefit all students; and Great Public Schools Now, dedicated to ensuring all Los Angeles students receive a highâ€quality education by accelerating the growth of highâ€quality public schools. 
 
 
 
 However, our program moves beyond serving students or teachers through the addition of the arts or arts integration into the curriculum. It is Turnaround Arts: California's unique comprehensive school-wide approach, a combination of arts education, strategic planning, and technical assistance that deepen and sustain the impact within our schools. Our program structure is a highâ€touch, intensive intervention model based on eight pillars that each school develops, maximizes, and mobilizes in pursuit of a highâ€quality, highâ€impact program. The Turnaround Arts pillars include a focus on: 1) principal leadership, 2) the strategic use of arts specialists, 3) nonâ€arts classroom teachers integrating arts into core content, 4) the use of teaching artists and community organizations, 5) the engagement of the district, parents, and community, 6) strategic arts planning, 7) professional development, and 8) improvements to the school environment. Each of these pillars can be used as levers for broader school improvement, targeting challenges commonly experienced by chronically lowâ€performing schools, such as low student engagement, negative perceptions of the school internally and externally, and low trust. Through a leveraged partnership model, our program is able to go beyond direct arts education and education nonprofits to transform school communities in and through the arts.","Turnaround Arts Los Angeles will focus on five key indicators of success with our partner schools:
 
 
 
 -Evidence of discrete arts education at every grade level;
 
 -Implementation of arts-based instructional strategies in the core subjects; 
 
 -Successful launch of a school musical or showcase;
 
 -Improved school culture and climate celebrating creativity, as evidenced by a year end survey; and
 
 -Increased family engagement through attendance of school events (e.g. family art nights), volunteerism with the arts or otherwise.
 
 
 
 The above key indicators are foundations upon which the following success measures are built: attendance and suspension rates, and changes in student proficiency in math and language arts. Turnaround Arts LA will also assess these measures, which we would not expect to change dramatically in one year, but more likely over a two-three year period.","TURNAROUND ARTS LOS ANGELES PROJECT BUDGET 2019-2020

 The Dream and the Highest Peak, By: Erik Lopez
 
 
 
 Racism feels like looking at a box of colored pencils without every color, full of emptiness
 
 And it tastes like all the bitterness of the world put in one lemon
 
 Racism is an on-going nightmare that has not yet ended
 
 Racism is the train thatâ€™s been going since 1807 that only carries depression
 
 It's just like numbers, it doesnâ€™t seem to end.
 
 
 
 Langston Hughesâ€™ unfulfilled dream will hopefully one day become a reality.
 
 
 
 So that anyone can fling their arms wide
 
 Enjoying the vibrant sunâ€™s smile
 
 And being allowed to dance
 
 Till the wonderful day is done
 
 As they watch the beautiful stars come on lightly like a warm blanket
 
 Then sleeping without worries and only comforting dreams.
 
 
 
 THAT IS THE DREAM!
 
 
 
 And the highest peak
 
 The peak that all civil rights activist want to reach
 
 But if they want to make the dream a reality,
 
 Then they have to pick up the pace to pass the point of the peak in stopping the painfulness of the racist to re-paint the picture of the passionate world with more colors than just white.","Turnaround Arts: Californiaâ€™s Regional Coach Program leverages local arts education resources and expertise across the state to provide weekly, ongoing support to Turnaround Arts: California partner schools.

By reusing instead of recycling electronics, our team transforms e-waste into opportunity.","In order to increase digital inclusion in LA, human-I-T needs to capture as much e-waste as possible. E-waste fuels our impact: the more we take in, the more households we can connect to technology and the more devices we can divert from a landfill. 
 
 
 
 Our biggest challenge is growing awareness around our e-waste service. Responsible disposal of technology is a relatively new phenomenon and recycling is widely considered to be best practice for getting rid of electronics today. Unfortunately, this solution overlooks the potential to reuse the entire device. When items are recycled, they are picked apart for precious commodities, and the remainder is shredded and exported to landfills. 
 
 
 
 Most consumers simply arenâ€™t aware that they can donate their unwanted device to a family who needs it. Weâ€™re striving to implement a new norm in which unwanted devices are given the chance at a second life. What Goodwill is for clothes, human-I-T is for technology. 
 
 
 
 human-I-T is upgrading our marketing strategy to grow awareness. This will happen at all levels: digital, print, media. The digital campaign will be particularly comprehensive, covering web design, Adwords management, social media posting, and SEO. Our team will A/B test the success of campaigns as well as the ROI to monitor effectiveness. Ultimately, the marketing campaign will allow us to get in front of â€œgatekeepersâ€ of technology, including IT Directors and Chief Technology Officers, to secure a higher volume of technology. 
 
 
 
 Beyond growing our traditional marketing strategies, we look to build relationships with businesses and referral partners. Our Donation Coordinator network throughout the area to find community members who can champion our cause internally at their employer. We help coordinate company-wide employee tech drives and work with the decision maker in IT to handle all company assets. This person-centered marketing approach allows us to maximize exposure.","human-I-T is the only nonprofit refurbisher in Southern California. Other organizations that take in e-waste either 1) break the devices down for commodities or 2) repurpose the device for resale on the market. Our approach is unique in that we reuse the device in its entirety, and donate it at no-cost to a low-income person in LA.
 
 
 
 human-I-T recognizes that we cannot erase the digital divide alone. Therefore, we cultivate partnerships with municipalities, schools, and community-based organizations to increase our collective impact in LA. We are active partners in the National Digital Inclusion Alliance (NDIA) as well as a steering member of the Alliance for Technology Refurbishment & Reuse (AFTRR). Both groups represent a network of institutions that focus on shrinking the digital divide. human-I-T represents Los Angeles in both of these communities. As a part of these groups, we advocate locally for legislation that ensures internet is available at a subsidized cost for low-income families. 
 
 
 
 We also coordinate with a number of local school districts to outreach about our services. Partners include the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles and Long Beach Unified School District. Through these channels, we outreach to over 100,000 Angelenos every year about the benefit and availability of low-cost internet.","We track several outputs to gauge the effectiveness our programs, including the number of computers donated, households connected to the internet, individuals providing digital training/ resources, and the pounds of e-waste diverted from landfills. We define success in 2019 as connecting 4,500 households to free or low-cost internet, donating 3,000 computer systems, and training 500 individuals on digital resources. 
 
 
 
 Beyond the numbers, we use qualitative data to gauge the programsâ€™ success. Our Programs Manager conducts post-donation surveys to measure how each connection makes an impact on usersâ€™ lives. We collect data about how many households use the device to apply to college, find affordable housing, secure new jobs, establish permanent residency, increase their social network, and access social services. Success is achieved when over 95% of recipients use their connection towards one of those goals, therefore increasing their presence in the community.","Last year, we experienced a 35% increase in families who reached out for access to our low-cost internet program. With the help of LA2050, we aim to scale our Programs Team to match the demand for our donation services.
 
 
 
 Currently, we have a team of three full-time, bilingual Program Coordinators who work with families to get them online. Every month, these team members subscribe over 250 households to low-income households to internet. This process is hands-on and time-intensive as Program Coordinators verify low-income eligibility, educate users about the options available, walk applicants through the application process, and provide technical support after connection. Still, each step is necessary to ensuring families understand the value of the internet connection and arenâ€™t upsold by Internet Service Providers during the process. 
 
 
 
 Grant funding from LA2050 will be used to hire two full-time and bilingual Program Coordinators over the next year at a rate of $50,000 annually. These staff members will connect an additional 80 households to low-cost internet, complete with a free computer system and digital training. In total, we expect an additional 1,800 Angelenos will be connected to the internet annually by investing in our Programs Team","As a part of operations, we separate technology donations into three categories: refurbish, resell, or recycle. Our first priority is to salvage any piece that can be refurbished into a functioning device for donation. Our second priority is to resell items that we are not able to donate. This includes electronics that do not have use for an individual or family (e.g. a six-foot server rack). We do so for two reasons: 1) to ensure the device is kept out of a landfill & recirculated back into the market and 2) to generate internal revenue for our mission. This accounts for over 60% of our annual revenue. 
 
 
 
 The last option for donated goods is to have them responsibly recycled (reserved only for products at the very end of their life). Products are sent to R2 Certified Recyclers that adhere to the most stringent regulations for disposing of technology. human-I-T is paid a small portion for each pound of e-waste that we responsibly recycle. 
 
 
 
 These avenues create a pocket of revenue to fund core administrative expenses and sustain our programs without relying on external funding.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff']","We take in unwanted technology (often thought of as ""e-waste"") from businesses and residents, fix it, and donate it back to low-income Angelenos free-of-charge. The outcome is straightforward: less technology waste and more people with technology. We pair donated computers with free or low-cost internet & digital training. These connections ensure Angelenos have the means to engage in civic processes and share local resources for events, housing, volunteerism, and so much more.","['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'LAUSD']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"LA is better place to connect when we all have equitable access to the digital world. One of the most poignant examples of that comes from a single mother of two named Hernanda. Hernanda faced many of the same struggles that all of our recipients do in getting online. Without a computer at home, she took two buses to access a computer at a local library and competed in long lines to get online. Once online, she was restricted to two hours of use. Hernanda was confronted with how to best use those two hours: whether to look for new job listings, help her children with homework, or find more affordable housing. With limited time, many job applications, health insurance forms, and school assignments remained incomplete. She was cut off from the digital resources for self-sufficiency desperately needed by her family. 
 
 
 
 Fortunately, with the addition of a new computer, internet connection, and digital literacy training from human-I-T, Hernanda was able to allocate proper time to job searching, helping children with their online homework, and accessing digital social services. Since receiving the donation, she gained employment at a rate of three additional dollars per hour, increasing her household revenue by $4,000 every year. She also became more engaged in her local neighborhood association with the encouragement of digital literacy training, helping to orchestrate Long Beachâ€™s tree planting campaign. Through it all, she was able to move off of government assistance and forge a path towards self-sufficiency. 
 
 
 
 Hernanda credits access to technology as her and her childrenâ€™s path upward: â€œThis program help[ed] my son with school tremendously. He was able to get ahead on his math and reading. He got a academic award for math and met all the AR reading goal for the first time this school year. And for me, I am taking 3 online classes right now which is so convenient for me cause [I] am able to be more active with my sons school activities and sports. It's also helpful for applying for jobs and setting up a resume. I've learned so much on this new technology, both about politics and my local news.""","Although human-I-T is submitting this application independently, we are only able to carry out our mission with the support of our nonprofit partners.

 -In LA, 1 in 4 people lack a computer with internet at home. Among the least connected are low-income people and people of color. Offline households are locked out from local resources that live online - including support groups, cultural events, job opportunities, transit-accessible housing, and voter records. 
 
 -At the same time, 150,000 computers are thrown away in the U.S. every day. These computers are referred to as e-waste - the fastest growing waste stream in the world. E-waste is teeming with toxic chemicals that deteriorate our air and soil quality. It causes severe health problems for residents living near landfills.
 
 
 
 human-I-T brings together these two problems to create one solution. We take in unwanted technology, refurbish it, and donate it back out to low-income households. Computers are coupled with access to wifi and digital training so recipients can tap into all of the opportunity that exists online. 
 
 
 
 For donors, we offer free pickup of technology, data sanitization, and a tax-deductible receipt for each item. Partners include the likes of County of Los Angeles and USC. Technology is then transported to our warehouse, where IT Staff refurbish items for donation. As items are repurposed, staff trains volunteers how to repair hardware components & administer technical support. This vocational training program completes the cycle in which excess technology from Angeleno consumers are repurposed by community members and later donated to low-income households in LA. This community-driven approach inspires the entire community to create impact by donating their unwanted goods to someone who desperately needs it.
 
 
 
 We also partner with Internet Service Providers to provide free and discount internet (starting at $10/month) to qualified low-income households. Our team outreaches to communities about options available to them, qualifies them for offers based on income and territory, educates about the different speeds available, and provides neutral guidance on what suits their needs best. human-I-T offers ongoing technical support to troubleshoot any hardware or software issues thereafter.
 
 
 
 At a time when college apps, job boards, healthcare, support groups, & volunteer opportunities are hosted digitally, human-I-T is committed to getting underserved populations plugged in. With every connection, low-income individuals are granted a seat at todayâ€™s digital table. Digital training then provides access to a world of transit-accessible housing, employment, public gatherings, emotional support networks, and government records.

6351075943,The Editorialist LA,"I believe LA boasts incredible untapped potential for content, so I launched my media company, The Editorialist LA, to provide curated content about Los Angeles to millennials, especially women.","As the business has grown, Iâ€™ve been able to capture an audience of over 100,000 followers across Instagram, my website, and other social media outlets. Iâ€™ve grown my web traffic, grown my social media presence on Pinterest and Facebook, and have worked with some incredible brand partners. Iâ€™ve learned how to manage and operate a real, income-generating business, reach out to brand partners, manage a budget, invoice clients, hire interns, create content, launch social media campaigns, and much more. But as my content veered more towards that of social media â€œinfluencers,â€ I realized that I was straying from my original intent. To provide the best, curated, personal, most up-to-date local content for a millennial audience. Which is why Iâ€™m applying for this LA2050 grant.
 
 
 
 I predict that my largest barrier will be the continued growth of my audience in a crowded digital media space, as well as generating necessary income without compromising on my initial vision. However, I've learned over the last few years that continuing to create the best content possible, honing in on a niche and voice, and connecting with your audience are the best strategies to continue growing and differentiating oneself in the media space. I believe that with the grant money, I will be able to invest properly in the branding and content, as well as employees to create that content, to fully realize this vision. I also believe that launching video content and having a personal representative of the content will fully differentiate the company, allowing the audience to finally find a media source that they can latch onto and keep coming back to for recommendations that they trust.","Though there are many local media sources in LA, I've always been disappointed by the content and informational offerings about Los Angeles. As a young millennial woman fresh out of college, there were few sources of media that spoke to me. The digital companies I most often looked to for information barely covered any local happenings, while our more established writers and editors spoke to audiences that were older and potentially more niche. I loved food, and considered myself a foodie, but I also wanted to know about the coolest new bars where all the young people were going. I wanted to know which new, cool startup brands were based in LA so I could support local businesses by purchasing their products. I wanted a face and a name speaking to me who I could recognize and who actually cared about the interests of young Angelenos, particularly women. 
 
 So while there are other blogs and websites about Los Angeles, there are few (if any) that cover all of these subjects-- food, fashion, beauty, fitness, activities, lifestyle, etc. And any that do are often not up-to-date, not packaging information in a way that is curated and digestible for overwhelmed readers. None of them are creating consistent digital video content about Los Angeles. And finally, none of them boast a personal, human feel that connects to the audience. With the rise of influencers, it's clear that audiences want a face to the digital content that they are consuming. They want to feel personally connected to it, so by putting a face to The Editorialist LA, we are providing Angelenos a media source that feels like a friend who they can trust.","I will define and measure success by both qualitative and quantitative measures. The first is a qualitative measure of content; once we are able to redesign and relaunch the company, I will measure our success by the quality of the content we are now creating. Neighborhood guides, restaurant reviews, travel guides, video content, photo content, social media content will all need to improve. Second, I will define and measure success by a few quantitative metrics. The first is content output-- namely, how much more local content are we creating with the addition of new employees, freelance writers, editors, etc? I will be setting goals to create consistent content in the categories I defined above (and more), and how much of that content I should be producing per day, week, month, etc. Second, I will define and measure success by our audience metrics. I will take a look at our web and social data to see how the content is performing, how many more audience members we are acquiring, if our newsletter is expanding, how many more social media followers we've gained, etc.","$100,000 Budget

Visitors flock to LA from all over, in search of a grandiose sense of glitz and glamour that left town a long time ago and maybe only ever existed on film. But thatâ€™s the problem with calling something superficial; those who do are guilty of the very sin themselves, as they have not put in the effort to dive beyond the surface to discover what lies beneath.
 
 In reality, LA has a deep, grounding culture that lives beneath that shiny surface. It's the lifeblood of the city, flowing through LAâ€™s streets, crashing on our sandy shores, seeping out of the cracks in the sidewalk, expanding outward into the suburban sprawl. Our culture is a mishmash of moving parts. It is simultaneously elusive but still easily identifiable and strangely palpable, as if it lives in the rays of the sun or the cool ocean breeze. As full of contradictions and complexities as the inhabitants of the city themselves. And it is a culture that I strongly felt growing up in the Valley. This culture was the connective thread to my parentsâ€™ childhood neighborhoods. To my grandfatherâ€™s time at USC and his offices in Hollywood. To my Great Auntâ€™s boutique in Beverly Hills and her meetings at Canterâ€™s Deli. To the homes in West LA where my parents lived when they met volunteering for the local City of Hope chapter. This culture has not just been the lifeblood of the city, but it runs through my blood as well.
 
 In 2014, I returned after earning my degree at Washington University in St. Louis to find a city that had transformed. Once classified as a black hole where culture goes to die, Los Angeles had gained acclaim as a food, fashion, and creative oasis. We now had a thriving and well-respected restaurant scene with some of the best up-and-coming chefs in the world, and an equally thriving art, fashion, culture, and start-up scene. This culture had always been there, but now it was out in the open, and others were finally starting to see it too.

First, I would redesign, rebrand, and relaunch my website and social media channels to be more LA-centric. The brand message will be clear; we are a local media company for millennials, and the one-stop-shop for all things Los Angeles culture. Next, I would hire some much-needed help from a Creative Director or Content Manager who can run the social media channels, and create more Los Angeles content, like neighborhood guides, local business features, and more. Additionally, Iâ€™m already looking into working with a large media company to produce a web series about Los Angeles, where I host guided neighborhood tours, restaurant visits, sit-downs with local business owners, and more. Currently, there are few people creating consistent video content about Los Angeles as a city, and I believe bringing a personal, human perspective would fill a much-needed gap in the local media space. Finally, I would launch an e-commerce platform to sell LA-made goods, as well as a reservation system to book restaurants, activities, and experiences while reading about them. My intent, through capturing a larger audience and creating more content, is to create a go-to media source for millennials encompassing everything they could possibly want to know about Los Angeles, but in a way that is enjoyable, palatable, and easily digestible. 
 
 The population being served by this project is mostly targeted at millennials, especially young women. But really, this project is for all Angelenos. Los Angeles natives, tourists, or people from all over who have moved here in the hopes of pursuing their dreams. I want to explore all this city has to offer, from the hottest new bars for 20-somethings to the hole-in-the-wall taco shops to new restaurants that families and people of all ages can enjoy. 
 
 Los Angeles is a city full of so much potential, but one of the hardest adjustments for residents to make is connection. Connecting to each other and the city itself. Sifting through information about the city is like trying to find a needle in a haystack that is over 500 square miles large. There are already so many cultural events to attend, local businesses to support, and things to do, and there are even more media sources that list out thousands of pages of overwhelming information. It's hard to not become paralyzed by the sheer amount of choices. But I want to make that information not just more readily available, but more easily packaged for a younger audience with a smaller attention span, and with a recognizable face that audiences can connect to. The goal is to create ONE go-to source of information that is highly curated, personal, and up-to-date, allowing Angelenos to finally cut through all the noise and find what they're looking for: things to do, ways to connect, how to support local businesses and restaurants, etc.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,

Hytch's mobile app promotes fewer SOV trips, increases ridership on public transportation, and connects the community.","Hytch is often seen as a competitor in the shared economy marketplace and has been viewed as a platform that pairs commuters. We are neither a competitor in this industry, nor do we pair commuters. We offer a highly complementary platform which can leverage existing mobility platforms and transportation assets. As the shared economy unfolds, Uber, Lyft, major auto manufacturers and tech companies are creating new autonomous cars and mobility solutions that Hytch can leverage. 
 
 
 
 Our strategy for overcoming data privacy concerns is inherent in our business model: Hytch pays people for their data because we view the commuter as our partner in acquiring valuable mobility data.","Hytch represents a highly complementary system and a tool to provide incentives for every Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS; ride-hailing, car-sharing, TDM service, etc.) market participant. Hytch has positioned itself as the largest carbon offset strategy in the world, where every shared ride is carbon neutral. The platform certifies every shared ride and its environmental impact. Hytch buys and retires carbon credits equivalent to the carbon saved by sharing a ride, making every Hytch carbon-neutral and producing cleaner air with every ride. Hytch is mode-agnostic and offers gamification strategies to drive behavior.
 
 
 
 At this time, and compared to RideAmigos, RideShark, LUUM, Scoop, Uber and Lyft, we are currently the only platform that provides cash rewards for shared rides and rewards emissions avoided, that uses GPS to verify trips, that personalizes in-app messaging/surveys, that protects Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and that operates without any personal data from employers.","Since baselines have been set for metrics regarding Public Transit (35% of Commuters), Attendance at Cultural Events (50% of Households), and Participation in Neighborhood Council Meetings (10% will Vote), we will use the Hytch platform to verify, track, and measure success in relation to those metrics. Trips will be verified in-app and surveys will be deployed to measure behavior change, adoption, and participation in all of the Connect metrics identified. We will work with LA2050 to better understand baseline information and provide dynamic visuals and heatmaps as a result of the data collected, while providing equitable and accessible transportation options during civic events.
 
 
 
 To track these goals, Hytch will:
 
 
 
 -Deliver mobility data without PII for the purpose of modeling impacts of each rule - i.e., sets of specific rewards - funded by the Campaign.
 
 -Develop a Campaign Dashboard to capture program metrics.
 
 -Define and deliver KPIs 
 
 -Extend a limited license to use existing and future platform/mobile application capabilities as the platform evolves over time.
 
 -Design geo-targeted marketing and educational content delivered by the platform helping ensure each Campaign participant is exposed on a regular basis to the appropriate alternative transit options.","The total $100,000 budget of the project will be used to design a public/private partnership and education campaign:

Our experience has shown that even when there is interest in participating in a food donation program, perceived legal issues - that in reality are non-existent - have been a major barrier. That's why our program focuses on in-person outreach, education concerning donor laws, and simple food recovery and recycling methods.

This grant will allow us to offer a free pilot program in which we can establish clear results in terms of community benefit, and perhaps more importantly to corporate offices, prove our service is financially beneficial.","Most of our colleagues emphasize the total weight of diverted food whereas our approach focuses on total business participation, regardless of size. The former provides an incentive to only work with big grocery stores or farmers markets. Yet there are so many restaurants, offices with catered lunches, and neighborhood grocers that are ignored.
 
 
 
 In the long-term, we think prioritizing total participation will lead to a better outcome when it comes to systemic cultural change across the city. To us, that's a requirement to feed the most people and prevent the most food from going to the landfill.
 
 
 
 Additionally, most organizations with similar goals work with their donors for free - we believe the path to systemic change is charging a fee to partners in order for organizations like our own to afford and scale their food sustainability operations. Despite the cost, we can still make it financially beneficial to participating businesses. 
 
 
 
 We can prove these assumptions if awarded this grant.","Success for this project hinges on whether we can prove the financial benefit to partnering businesses. Their participation is required to change the culture around surplus food in Los Angeles and we understand they also have to worry about their bottom line. If we can show that they still come out ahead after paying our fee, we will have created a no-brainer win-win situation for both businesses and the communities they serve across the county.
 
 
 
 Every food donation may be eligible for tax breaks.
 
 
 
 The consulting aspect of our service utilizes customized data to reduce costs currently spent on purchasing or producing food that will ultimately be wasted - which happens at every single grocery store and restaurant in the city.
 
 
 
 We'll develop and promote sales on items that are nearing the end of their perceived shelf life, enabling businesses to realize a return on the food they're currently throwing away.
 
 
 
 Our certification can become a staple in advertising to consumers looking to support businesses making a positive impact in their city.
 
 
 
 And there are many other strategies we will develop and implement over time.
 
 
 
 The bottom line is food waste is one of the biggest contributors to climate change in the world, over 40% of our fresh food is thrown away, and we have millions of hungry people in Los Angeles. That has to change.
 
 
 
 Once we have businesses on board, our success will be defined by eliminating hunger in our county and vastly reducing it's contribution to climate change. 
 
 
 
 We won't stop until we achieve those objectives.","Wages ($65,000) - Labor includes consulting, partner management, data analysis, logistics and transportation, and more.
 
 
 
 Equipment ($15,000) - Supplies for storage and transportation of surplus food.

 Educational Materials ($3,000) - Our web-based video course focused on food sustainability and food safety that features a quiz to ensure retention - open to all, required for our partners' employees.
 
 
 
 Marketing ($2,000) - Supports campaigns for the FoodCycle Certification Program and provides promotion for our partner donors.","As mentioned, our service will cost an ongoing fee for participating businesses. This grant will provide us the necessary funds to start a pilot program to prove the feasibility of our endeavor. From there, we will roll out the premium version and scale across the county using our self-sustaining model.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","We'll recover surplus food from grocery stores, restaurants, and offices and ensure it feeds the millions of food insecure Angelenos instead of the landfill. 
 
 
 
 Our comprehensive program utilizes cutting edge technology powered by ChowMatch, an app that handles food donation logistics, and offers consulting services that prevent waste.
 
 
 
 While reducing climate change and hunger in Los Angeles, we'll cut operating costs for businesses, provide tax breaks, and offer marketing and sales support!","['Central LA', 'East LA', 'San Gabriel Valley', 'San Fernando Valley', 'South LA', 'Westside', 'South Bay', 'County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"We speak with a lot of employees at local restaurants that want to help these causes but feel like they can't due to corporate regulations governing their business. Despite being turned down, we still take our time to speak with interested people at these restaurants to rally them around food sustainability. It's never a direct ""no"", it's a ""maybe later."" Often times, with patience and well-timed follow-up conversations we can turn motivation into concrete, measurable impact.
 
 
 
 One case, in particular, is striking.
 
 
 
 We target food dense areas around the city, one being Larchmont Village - a wonderful area with many shops and restaurants bunched together. After some outreach, we signed up one restaurant to begin donating their excess food. Although we tried reaching out to many businesses there, we only had this one store for seven months.
 
 
 
 Then something changed.
 
 
 
 We went back to businesses that said ""maybe later"" with a new approach focused on highlighting positive outcomes realized from their neighbor's contribution. We were a little more hands-on in suggesting customized recovery programs that would suit their store and explained how easy it is.
 
 
 
 A courageous employee presented a strongly-worded pitch to her manager.
 
 
 
 After that, we had a new partner.
 
 
 
 Then we spoke about the positive outcomes from two neighboring restaurants to prospective partners. 
 
 
 
 Then we got another.
 
 
 
 All of a sudden we were witnessing a massive chain reaction and within a few weeks we had nine different businesses donating their food to us on a daily basis.
 
 
 
 It's now a simple - and normal - part of their routine. 
 
 
 
 We were able to turn employee inspiration into dozens of meals every single day.","We have a growing network of partner donors and receiving agencies across the city, including several businesses that are ready to join our pilot certification program.
 
 
 
 Our partnership with ChowMatch connects us to a large and reliable network of volunteers and receiving agencies, and introduces cutting edge technology to help track and document successful food waste prevention and recovery strategies.

 We focus on five key areas:
 
 
 
 1.) Outreach & Education - It all starts with a grassroots campaign, talking with people and businesses in our community, which we've been doing for 13 years. Through an online video course, we'll inspire by highlighting issues surrounding food sustainability and food safety. It's open to all and required of partner business employees.
 
 
 
 2.) Waste Prevention - On Day 1, we'll establish a baseline with each business, evaluating their current waste, and install customized food recovery and recycling programs. Our service will leverage ongoing data tracking and analysis to continually improve our partners' impact.
 
 
 
 3.) Food Recovery - Through our existing network of partner donors, recipients, and collaborating organizations, we already have the infrastructure needed to deliver surplus food to the hungry. Our partnership with ChowMatch ensures we'll be able to add new partners to our network and begin bringing their excess to local kitchens, shelters, and food banks right from the start.
 
 
 
 4.) Food Recycling - We have established partnerships with organizations in the community that turn inedible food waste into renewable energy forms through methods like composting. We'll provide proper storage and transportation to these facilities.
 
 
 
 5.) Marketing and Sales Support - Every participating business is eligible to be FoodCycle Certified, which will earn them a window sticker and promotional materials. Additionally, we'll work with businesses to create sales for food that is nearing the end of its shelf life. In other words, we'll help them turn the food they would've previously wasted into some type of financial return. Through our newsletter and social media, we'll provide a signal boost for these businesses. 
 
 
 
 Our goal is to prove to local businesses that working with us will not only be great for Los Angeles and the world, but it can help their bottom line. 
 
 
 
 We're creating a win-win scenario.
 
 
 
 Our program will be the first of its kind in the US at this scale, ensuring LA is the best place to LIVE!

6760401746,Boys & Girls Clubs of Carson,"Our mission is to offer our young people a safe environment where they can be themselves, dedicated adults who respect them, and outcome-based programs that empower youth to become lifelong learners.","The BGCCâ€™s most significant challenge is also the reason why the BGCCâ€™s work is so necessary and life-changing to the youth in the community. Numbers paint a vivid picture of just how different the South Los Angeles and Carson areas are from your typical community or the images on television of Beverly Hills or Hollywood. The majority of youth in these communities are growing up under extremely difficult circumstances facing abject poverty, homelessness, and food insecurity on a daily basis. The BGCCâ€™s challenge is to make the playing field more equitable so that no matter what a childâ€™s zip code is, they still have access to a future that is full of employability and economic security. BGCC CEO, Kim Richards, stated, â€œone of the most daunting challenges we face at our Club is the inequitable opportunities in our community. The BGCC is working to ensure that every child has the support to overcome the cycle of povertyâ€.","Unfortunately, every year, many community members sign their children up for afterschool programs run by unregulated entrepreneurs. Often times, these afterschool programs are taught by staff with no teaching experience or qualifications to work with youth. While there are other afterschool providers in the Carson and South Los Angeles area, there is not one that provides the depth of programs and experience, which allows underserved youth a tailored path to high school graduation and successful lives. 
 
 
 
 By contrast to other afterschool programs in the community, the BGCC programs have proven results. The BGCC is part of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA), which provides the BGCC with a host of research-driven, evidence-based programs that the BGCC is able to customize for the local communityâ€™s needs. The programs are developed by both local and national experts in youth development and would be cost-prohibitive for a stand-alone afterschool program to attempt to develop. 
 
 
 
 The BGCC advances after-school youth programming and stands out from the rest through one-on-one case management. College Bound and Workforce Case Managers track youth successes and challenges in order to provide each young person a customized experience including tools to plan long-term and short-term educational and career goals. Through case management, youth gain the skills to achieve academic success and plan for life beyond high school.","BGCCâ€™s evaluation process reflects its commitment to continuous quality improvement. We regularly measure the effectiveness of our programs and their impact on membersâ€™ lives. The BGCC will collect data on the following to evaluate its programs: (1) Number of youth served; (2) Participation rates; (3) Grades; (4) Grade progression; (5) High school graduation rates and (6) Improvement in competencies and behaviors, self-esteem, confidence and perceptions. Registration forms document enrollment numbers. Sign-in sheets and rosters record daily attendance and participation in activities. The BGCC uses transcripts, report cards and academic case management files to track grades, grade progression and academic progress. The data is compiled and reviewed monthly. For youth who stay in the LAUSD school system, the BGCC tracks grade progression through its data sharing partnership with LAUSD and local schools. The BGCC works closely with the administration of schools to receive transcripts. Parents/guardians sign consent forms, allowing schools to release their childâ€™s information to the BGCC in order to track academic outcomes. Pre/Post-tests measure changes in skills and knowledge. The BGCC implements the BGCA National Youth Outcomes Initiative (NYOI). This includes the annual National Outcome Survey, which measures improvements in self-confidence and self-esteem. The Vice President of Operations meets bi-monthly with program staff to evaluate activities and make programmatic adjustments. This provides staff with on-going opportunities to discuss best practices and address challenges.","BGCC College & Career Access Project Budget: 2019 â€“ 2020 School Year

 The BGCC AIM (Achievement in Middle School) PROGRAM is a one-on-one case management program for youth ages 11-13 that focuses on providing core competencies through intensive academic tutoring, mentoring and experiential learning. AIM is designed to instill confidence in youth as they successfully move into middle school, and again into high school. 
 
 
 
 The BGCC COLLEGE BOUND PROGRAM is a year-round program offering youth ages 6-18 opportunities to participate in workshops, college field trips, and receive one-on-one academic case management. College workshops provide youth with hands-on activities on topics that include paying for college and stress management. Many of our youth step foot on a college campus for the first time because of BGCC college field trips. Youth see first-hand how to get involved in college through sports, clubs, and student leadership groups. BGCC Club alumni provide tours of their own campuses, giving youth a stronger connection to the college experience, and allowing them to see how they can make it through high school and into college.

We create positive bilingual learning environments for underprivileged youth through innovative educational programs.,"Our bilingual programs may be considered unorthodox to those who are acclimated with the traditional school system.Â The mobile classroom is a fresh take on tradition because of the teachers, programs offered, learning style and layout of the classroom environment.Â We believe in a strong foundation of learning basics such as math, science, and writing but do so in an interactive way and a way that is applicable to what engages students.Â Our programs also encourage students to find what excites them and to follow that passion instead of always being stuck to the rules of traditional school work.Â These ideas are relatively new and disrupt traditional teaching methods so that may be an initial barrier to some as we introduce this program to students. We welcome anyone who is intrigued or skeptical about this way of teaching to sit in on a class and see the benefits. We believe interactive, engaging and open lesson plans are the future of education and support students to be more empathetic, excited about learning and to be immersed in their communities.Â",There is an organization called Five Keys which operates a mobile classroom in the San Francisco area. Their focus is on helping young adults and adults attain their high school diploma or GED. Often times their core students are homeless.

We also have our own metrics system that will survey and measure students engagement, grades and what their goals are for the future.

The combination of the Schools On Wheels Bus and the Beyond The Classroom bus will engage children in learning courses and traveling to specific field trips to complement their work in the classroom. One of our goals for Fall 2019 is to expose kids in the program to unexpected opportunities in the fields of language arts, math, technology, science, entertainment, and the arts. 
 
 January 2020 - April 2020
 
 Spring: By Spring of 2020 our programs will bloom into successful metrics as we look forward to a fully developed system working with LAUSD for the new school year of 2020 - 2021. 
 
 
 
 Places we look forward to collaborating with: California Science center,LA Zoo,LA Brea Tar Pits, J.P.L.,WB Studios, and more.
 
 
 
 MEASURABLE PROGRESS:
 
 When every member of the community has equal opportunity then everyone thrives. Our programs will create an engaging and impactful bilingual educational experience for the less fortunate communities in Los Angeles. It's not just statistics that will make this change it is the programs innovation and the opportunity for those who don't have access to a strong education program that will help make Los Angeles the best place to LEARN and PLAY.",,,,Active,LEARN,,,Voting Period,
6828175464,Mayor's Fund for Education (Fiscal Sponsor: Community Partners),The Mayorâ€™s Fund for Education amplifies educational efforts to provide a cradle-to-career approach to ensure all students have access to educational pathways resulting in a thriving community.,"The Mayorâ€™s Fund realizes that reaching 100% early education enrollment County-wide will not happen over-night. In fact, cultural preferences and common practices among various socio-economic groups of keeping children in the home until Kindergarten will present a significant challenge to ever accomplishing the 100% target. To address this, it is crucial that the LB Initiative partners work to ensure parents have as much information as possible to consider when making decisions for their family. This information must be culturally sensitive, multi-lingual, and provide clarity around the variety of early education facilities in Long Beach, whether center or home-based. It will also be important to ensure that parents are aware of financial support that may be available through subsidized programs to help reduce their cost incurred. And, finally, it will be important that families understand the lasting impact ECE enrollment can have on their childrenâ€™s future. 
 
 
 
 As we work towards the goal of 100% enrollment, it will also be vital to continue to build foundational skills in all children (whether enrolled or not) by supporting learning in a variety of settings. To this end, developmentally-appropriate learning techniques must be made readily accessible to families outside of formal early education centers. The Long Beach Initiative will support families in their role as a childâ€™s â€œfirst teacherâ€ by making empowering resources available to all families. One such resource is the Mayorâ€™s Fundâ€™s ReadyRosieLB Family Engagement Program which puts resources directly into the hands of families via simple yet effective trainings that can be accessed at the familyâ€™s convenience. Since its launch only one year ago, the ReadyRosieLB program has registered over 3,000 users and provided over 40,000 Family Learning Opportunities. Support from LA2050 will support the continuation of this innovative program, particularly its recent expansion to the over 17,000 families accessing services within Long Beachâ€™s five WIC centers.","As previously stated, the LB Initiative will be a collaboration between the Mayor's Fund, the City of Long Beach and the Long Beach ECE Committee. This collaborative effort will be vital to ensuring that work between the respective organizations is aligned, complimentary and never duplicative. 
 
 
 
 Although the Mayorâ€™s Fund works with numerous non-profit organizations and civic partners to support ECE in the City of Long Beach, no other organization has the scope of support and unique platform available to the Mayorâ€™s Fund. The Mayorâ€™s Fund is uniquely positioned between typical educational institutions and local government to help identify gaps, meet needs, and better connect partners with common goals. The Mayorâ€™s Fund is also an innovative mechanism by which to leverage Mayoral support of education priorities within the Long Beach community. Unlike other nonprofits and local partners, the Mayor's Fund has the unique opportunity to directly leverage the Mayor's gravitas and platform in support of its mission and the objectives of the ECE Strategic Plan â€“ a document the Mayor has himself set as a priority for the City.","The cultural and perception shift targeted by the LB Initiative efforts (i.e. increased early education enrollment) can be difficult to track within a single year. However, success of the LB Initiative can still be evidenced by indicators within all three of the impact areas outlined above - Expanding Early Education Enrollment, Broadening Community Awareness, and Increasing Family Resources. 
 
 
 
 These include:
 
 
 
 o Increased attendance at community engagement events
 
 o High attendee satisfaction ratings from community engagement events 
 
 o Increased internships facilitated within early education settings
 
 o Overall Impressions from digital and/or printed campaign materials
 
 o Consistent engagement with social media posts
 
 o Increased attendance at parent training opportunities 
 
 o High attendee satisfaction ratings from parent trainings 
 
 o Increased registrations with ReadyRosieLB

As the proposed LB Initiative addresses only a few of its â€œshort-termâ€ activities, the Mayorâ€™s Fund and DHHS will continue to fund-raise to support the Planâ€™s additional mid-term and long-term Objectives. Success will also rely on the continued collective efforts of the Initiativeâ€™s collaborative partners, their in-kind contributions, and the continued financial support of existing and/or on-going programs. Additionally, the Mayorâ€™s Fund anticipates on-going support from supporters for its existing programs ($110,000), such as The Boeing Company and the Munzer Foundation.","['Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","The Long Beach 2019 Early Learning Initiative will support the implementation of the Cityâ€™s Early Childhood Education Strategic Plan. 
 
 
 
 The Long Beach community recognizes that childâ€™s first 5 years are crucial for building the foundations that will affect how they learn and interact for the rest of their lives.
 
 
 
 This Initiative will build organizational capacity across multiple institutions to Expand Early Education Enrollment, Broaden Community Awareness, and Increase Family Support Resources.","['South Bay', 'Greater Long Beach Community']",Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"Life-long success, experts have discovered, starts very early. A childâ€™s first 5 years are crucial for building the foundations that will affect how they learn, react, and interact with the world around them for the rest of their lives, as 90% of brain development happens during this period. As every dollar invested in ECE produces a 13% return, such investments are crucial to reducing the achievement gap, reducing the need for special education, increasing the likelihood of healthier lifestyles, lowering the crime rate, and reducing overall costs to society.
 
 
 
 Approximately 7% of the Long Beach population is under 5 years old and 36% of Long Beach children are born into and live in poverty. Additionally, approximately 23% of Long Beach children are eligible for subsidized preschool enrollment, yet go unserved. This is particularly concerning as by age 4, low-income children have heard 30 million fewer words than their middle and upper-class peers, one determinant in the socio-economic achievement gap. Without targeted interventions, these children will have a higher likelihood of entering kindergarten behind their higher income and ECE-enrolled peers. Long Beach families have also expressed the need for increased resources for supporting the development of their children, support in finding and affording high-quality child care, social connection, and more communal locations supporting learning opportunities. 
 
 
 
 It is clear, therefore, that supporting early learning at home, in ECE centers, among parenting groups, in libraries, parks, or even pubic spaces can make a big difference for children and families. As a result, the City of Long Beach Health and Human Services Department, in collaboration with Mayorâ€™s Fund for Education, the Long Beach Early Childhood Education Committee, and the Long Beach Unified School District, worked to create the Long Beach ECE Strategic Plan. This plan is a blueprint for collective action and making significant improvements for all children of Long Beach by removing barriers, considering the hole child, and ensuring that all children and their families receive the opportunities they need to succeed.","The Long Beach ECE Strategic Plan was created through a collaborative effort between the Mayorâ€™s Fund for Education, the City of Long Beach Health and Human Services Department (DHHS), and Long Beach Early Childhood Education Committee (LBECEC). Just as there was shared ownership in its creation, likewise is there shared ownership of meeting the Planâ€™s Objectives. Achieving the Goals and Objectives identified in the plan will require on cross-sector coordination and collaboration â€“ with responsibly for addressing the Plan's over 100 activities falling to many different community partners. The Mayorâ€™s Fund for Education is, therefore working in close collaboration with both DHHS and LBECEC. 
 
 
 
 As a policy document of the City of Long Beach, DHHS is ultimately beholden to City Management and City Council for progress around the Planâ€™s 7 primary Goals. However, the Mayorâ€™s Fund will be Co-Chairing the Planâ€™s Strategic Oversight Committee with DHHS and working to raise funding necessary to meet the Planâ€™s short, mid, and long-term objectives. The Chair of the LBECEC will also have a position on the Planâ€™s Oversight Committee to help ensure alignment of work between the various efforts. 
 
 
 
 Likewise, the Mayorâ€™s Fund and DHHS have positions on the Board of Directors of the LBECEC and have helped facilitate the Committeeâ€™s strategic alignment with the Plan. The LBECEC has a long and successful history of supporting early education and families in Long Beach. As its membership is comprised of representatives from over 40 ECE providers and family support entities, the Committee will play a crucial role in outreach directly to families, informing the development of effective messaging, and creating internship opportunities within the field.",kselvester@mayorsfundfored.org,Karissa Selvester,562-548-0440,[],[],[],[],Non-profit organization,['No'],"@LBHealthECEP

 The Mayor's Fund serves the City of Long Beach, the 7th most populous in California, 10th across the nation in overall diversity, and the 5th most LGBTQ+ friendly city in the nation. Of Long Beachâ€™s nearly 500,000 populous, over 40% identifies as Latino/Hispanic, 29% identify as White, 13% identify as African American and over 12% identify as Asian (which includes the largest Cambodian population living outside of Cambodia). Approximately 26% of Long Beach residents are immigrants, 13.9% of households are headed by a single parent, and 7% of the population is under 5 years old.
 
 
 
 The organizational capacity and program support provided by the LB Initiative will result in three key impacts beginning in July 2019, extending through June 2020: Expanded Early Education Enrollment, Broadened Community ECE Awareness, and Increased Family Support Resources. Through improved alignment of educational systems, community mapping, and data gathering, the Mayorâ€™s Fund and its partners will more effectively meet the objectives of the ECE Strategic Plan and help ensure that all children have equitable access to learning opportunities.
 
 
 
 The LB Initiative will help expand ECE enrollment by leveraging events such as Long Beach Early Learning Festivals and Celebration of the Young Child, which are well attended by ECE providers and families alike. These events enable partners to directly engage and inform families of the early education and enrollment options available to them. Additionally, recognizing that enrollment cannot expand without adequately staffed ECE centers, the Mayorâ€™s Fund will support higher education pathways to this career by helping to increase internship placements within centers.
 
 
 
 Outside of individual events, the LB Initiative will also develop and implement Awareness Campaigns to provide consistent and highly visible messages around the importance of ECE and enrollment. With the added benefit of its connection to the office of Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia (one of the most highly visible figures in the area), the Mayorâ€™s Fund will be able to help in the dissemination of these messages to a very broad audience.
 
 
 
 Finally, the Mayorâ€™s Fund aims to support early learning in a variety of settings and all children building crucial foundational skills by making developmentally-appropriate learning techniques readily accessible to all families. The LB Initiative will support families in their role as a childâ€™s â€œfirst teacherâ€ by expanding family support resources â€“ including its ReadyRosie Family Engagement Program and various parent training workshops.",,,,Active,LEARN,,,Voting Period,

6897136347,City Year Los Angeles,"Our mission is to build democracy through citizen service, civic leadership and social entrepreneurship. We approach our mission by addressing the inequitable distribution of educational resources.","One of the potential challenges to our program is ensuring that we have enough AmeriCorps members each year to meet the needs of the schools we serve and to continue to expand our service to additional schools in the community. As our nationâ€™s economy fluctuates, it has become more challenging to attract AmeriCorps applicants to work essentially as volunteers. This requires attracting potential AmeriCorps applicants who not only have the right experience but also have the conviction and commitment to carry out this necessary and demanding work. In order to address this potential challenge and build our recruitment pipeline to assemble a roust cohort of AmeriCorps members, we have hired a local recruiter, to supplement the work of the regional recruiter from our national organization. We have also increased our presence at California State Universities to increase awareness of City Year among the demographic most likely to apply. As a long-term strategy to ensure that our recruitment remains effective, we are considering raising the stipend our AmeriCorps members receive in order to appeal to more applicants.","Other organizations doing similar work in Los Angeles include LA Team Mentoring, 826 LA, and School on Wheels. All of these organizations offer tutoring and/or mentoring in some capacity to high-need students in Los Angeles. What differentiates City Year Los Angeles is that we have the only program in Los Angeles that is available to its students for the entire school day and after school. City Year AmeriCorps members arrive at their school sites before the first bell rings, support students throughout the day and stay at school until the last student leaves our after-school program. AmeriCorps members facilitate â€œExtended Learning Timeâ€ or â€œELTâ€ after school on every Monday-Thursday of service. Extended Learning Time gives students a chance to complete homework, receive tutoring and ask important questions. It also provides a safe space for students after school, and helps keep them engaged in the academic culture of their campus.
 
 
 
 City Year AmeriCorps members are in a unique position compared to the tutors and mentors of other programs. They have access to not only critical data that will help them better help their students succeed, but also to their studentsâ€™ teachers and parents. Being able to collaborate with the people in the studentsâ€™ lives who know them best give AmeriCorps members the opportunity to craft individual interventions tailored to their studentsâ€™ past performance and specific learning style.","City Year Los Angeles will define and measure success through the following goals and objectives: 
 
 
 
 1) Providing individualized support from AmeriCorps members to a minimum of 2,500 â€œfocus listâ€ students with approximately 15 hours of one-to-one targeted intervention per student
 
 
 
 2) 50% of focus list students that City Year AmeriCorps members work with in social emotional development demonstrate improvement in at least three of the Deveraux Student Strengths Assessment metrics
 
 
 
 3) 50% of focus list students the City Year AmeriCorps members work with in math and English improve failing grades, maintain passing grades, or meet/exceed their expected growth on the math and English Inventories assessment; and
 
 
 
 4) At least 85% of teachers will report that City Year AmeriCorps members a) improve the academic performance of the students they tutor, b) improve the confidence of the students they tutor, and c) foster a positive environment for learning.","City Year Los Angeles will use the grant funding as follows:

As an AmeriCorps program we receive approximately a third of our annual budget from the federal government. Last fall, Californiaâ€™s Chief Service Officer Karen Baker shared at our Opening Day Ceremony that City Year provides the best return on investment of all their grantees, with both good impact data and strong private sector investment. As a result, California Volunteers grew its funding per AmeriCorps member to nearly $14,000 a member or $3.6M a year â€“ our largest annual grant ever â€“ which bolsters our public revenue.
 
 
 
 Our Individual Giving team invites donors to fund the cost of AmeriCorps members as part of our â€œRed Jacket Societyâ€ (RJS), which consists of more than 40 donors giving at the $10,000 level and above. This year RJS has increased its number of three-year pledges, which supports our long-term sustainability by allowing us to plan future revenue. Our Corporate Giving team makes asks to major companies to sponsor our school teams or different program components, such as STEM and Social Emotional Learning. Team sponsors support the deployment of an AmeriCorps team to a high-need school, with a gift of $100,000 or more. We currently have 8 corporate team sponsors, including Riot Games, AT&T, Comcast NBCUniversal, and The Walt Disney Company. Foundation contributions include those from the Hauptman Family Foundation, Rosenthal Family Foundation, Weingart Foundation, Rose Hills Foundation, Windsong Trust, among others. Additionally, our annual benefit, ""Spring Break,"" raises 20% of our private revenue each year.
 
 
 
 We are currently seeking increased investment from the public sector. Our External Affairs department engages with superintendents, school board members, and public figures in order to grow awareness of City Yearâ€™s impact and value to the communities we serve. It is our long term goal to secure a line item in the California state budget which would support service programs funded by federal and private funds. Additionally, we are seeking to be included in Los Angeles School District budget rather than through each of our partner schoolsâ€™ individual budgets. Both of these measures will make City Year Los Angeles a secure fixture in LAUSD and the communities we serve.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","City Year Los Angeles unites young leaders of all backgrounds, known as AmeriCorps members, for a year of full-time service to help students succeed and stay on-track to graduate.

She appreciated the fact that Ms. Erin was young and could relate to her. â€œI didnâ€™t know much about why she was there. I just knew she wore a bright yellow jacket and Timberland boots and she was the only person I could rely on for help with algebra.â€ With Ms. Erinâ€™s help, Esmerelda passed Algebra I and culminated from middle school on time, thus entering high school set up to graduate on time.
 
 
 
 But this is not where the story ends. Ten years later, Esmerelda, now a college graduate from Cal State Northridge, attended a career fair where she saw a familiar yellow jacket hanging in one of the booths. She was instantly reminded of the impact that Ms. Erin left on her and approached the booth to learn more about City Year. â€œI learned that City Year AmeriCorps members are sent into schools to help kids like me realize their full potential; to be that role model we needed in our lives to gain the confidence we needed to pass our classes.â€

Through our Whole School Whole Child program (WSWC), each City Year Los Angeles AmeriCorps member works with a focus list of students who most need individualized support, as determined through classroom observations, teacher collaboration and start-of-year assessments. We use this data to customize our services to provide each student with the support they need. These interventions are based on the three â€œEarly Warning Indicatorsâ€ of not graduating:
 
 
 
 - Attendance â€“ AmeriCorps members monitor attendance of their focus list students, call home when students are absent, and have conversations with students to give them the support they need to arrive at school every day.
 
 
 
 - Behavior â€“ Based on behavior records, teacher recommendations, and an assessment administered at the start of the year, each AmeriCorps member identifies a cohort of students who need additional social-emotional support, which includes goal-setting and self-reflection exercises.
 
 
 
 - Course Performance â€“ Our AmeriCorps members provide students with individualized, one-to-one academic support, providing students with the high-quality, data-driven interventions in English and math.
 
 
 
 City Year Los Angeles currently serves students in grades 3 to 9, ranging in age from 8-15 years old, living in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Boyle Heights, Westlake/Koreatown, South L.A and Watts. Twenty-five percent are English-Language Learners and 99% percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. This year we will provide individualized intervention to more than 2,600 students, whole class support to more than 12,000 students, and whole school support to more than 25,000 students.
 
 
 
 From June to August, our cohort of AmeriCorps members attend trainings and prepare for service. At the start of the school year, our AmeriCorps members are deployed in teams to schools across Los Angeles. Between September and October, our AmeriCorps members administer start-of-year assessments to students and their focus list students are determined. From that point, throughout the year, AmeriCorps members design and implement the individualized interventions in math and English, which are customized for their focus list students based on their assessment results. In May, students take their last round of inventories to assess their growth.

Over last 20 years, NALIP has proudly equipped Latinx and diverse voices with the proper tools to enter the industry including funding for projects. 
 
 
 
 One example of how NALIP has impacted the industry and creatives is through our Latino Lens Incubator program. Through partnerships with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Time Warner Foundation we have been able to fund short content projects for diverse filmmakers in the industry. 
 
 
 
 One of our most recent participants is Kase Pena, who was a finalist, screened her short film at our Media Fest, and is in the process of selling that film and distributing it to a major network. Through our mentorship process, we recommended her for a TV show that was staffing and looking for women, people of color, and Trans writers. Kase is currently a staffed writer on this show, earning writing credits from a major network.
 
 
 
 Another NALIP member who has also been a part of our programs is Nancy C. Mejia: she was a semifinalist for one of our Latino Lens Incubators. Through our programs, she was able to achieve her 3-5 year goal of being a writer into 18 months. She has most recently been staffed on a critically acclaimed TV series, VIDA on STARZ and was brought back for the second season to direct two episodes.
 
 
 
 NALIP strongly feels that the mentorship component of our programs is crucial to their success. It is through this, that creatives receive guidance to fortify their skills and obtain the necessary tools to advance in the industry. The NALIP Board of Directors, Executive Director, and staff all work together to connect with Latinx and diverse storytellers in need of hands-on support in order to develop strong careers in a very competitive industry that is slow to embrace Latinx and diverse creators, stories or content.

The initiative will be an informative, step-by-step guide for young content creators to be integrated into the entertainment industry. These young creators, primarily between 18-24 years of age, will possess a demonstrated interest in pursuing a career in media. Through the physical and digital platforms NALIP will provide, the Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative will reach over 100,000 Angelenos and promote the advancement of emerging talent.
 
 
 
 NALIP aims to host a variety of events for participants of the Emerging Content Creators Inclusion Initiative throughout the year. 
 
 
 
 Summer: Participants of this initiative will be able to further realize their passion for creating through special workshops during the NALIP Media Summit. They will also have a scheduled agenda to attend the best panel sessions geared toward their career goals. During this time, there will also be participants that can be part of the volunteer/internship opportunities that NALIP has to offer.
 
 
 
 Fall: Participants will attend a workshop or mentorship session that coincides with the Media Fest, a two-day festival featuring content by Latinx creatives. They will be able to take a look at the careers of seasoned professionals as well as break into intimate groups where they can have more one-on-one mentorship sessions with these industry experts.

 Between the months of January and June: NALIP will host a series of workshops and events for participants to continue the facilitation of their careers. 
 
 
 
 NALIP will also create the submission process for emerging creatives involved in the initiative to submit a concept and garner funding for projects that will grant them entry into an accredited institution for higher education. 
 
 
 
 This project will make measurable progress towards making LA the best place to create by increasing the resources available to emerging creatives in order for them to succeed in this industry and continue to advance their creative platform. This program will be offered throughout Los Angeles and its extremities to create an accessible point of entry for emerging creators.

A group of friends in a Los Angeles apartment were struggling to find an innovative and synergistically meaning manner in which to support fellow Angelenos experiencing homelessness. After a few failed community outreach attempts, the groups of friends decided to create a unique giving experience.The group of friends went to their local grocery store and bought enough food to prepare 100 lunches. The friends connected with each other on a different level, while having the time of their lives! Through this jovial and meaningful effort, the friends connected with their communities on a different level as well. The groupâ€™s first distribution was near the Santa Monica Pier and Venice Boardwalk; the group connected with various individuals experiencing homelessness and hunger. The friends shared the meals they prepared and received insight into the experiences of their homeless neighbors. After the initial experience, the friends sought to share this experience with more of their friends â€“ by repeating and expanding their efforts. Through social media platforms, the group tagged photos of their experiences with #HashtagLunchbag as an ode to hashtags and their efforts. Thus, the advocacy campaign and outreach project that is #HashtagLunchbag was initiated. They decided to repeat their #HashtagLunchbag efforts in January 2013. As the impact increased, the scope and goal of #HashtagLunchbag expanded. Eventually, #HashtagLunchbag set a goal of making 1,000 meals. 100 people arrived to support the effort, and 1,000 meals were successfully made and distributed. Additionally, group members added love notes of encouragement to each meal to further acknowledge the fellow humans the group members were feeding and connecting with, to remind their fellow Angelenos that they were visible and important community members.

The Love Wall will be strategically installed in protected areas, for large projections on buildings and throughout neighborhoods across Los Angeles County. In the tradition of the â€œlove notesâ€ placed in lunchbags during our #HashtagLunchbag events, people across Los Angeles County, and beyond, can upload love notes to the digital wall via an app. The user is given the chance to purchase lunch for someone experiencing homelessness, from afar, while spreading their message far & wide, through the wall projection, for a fee of $3 per note.

 Information about the population being served â€¨
 
 On any given day in Los Angeles County, there are approximately 53,000 people experiencing homelessness. The Love Wall strives to impact the mitigation of homelessness & serve a multitude of populations including, but not limited to, Angelenos experiencing homelessness; Angelenos looking to engage & connect with fellow community members, & serve fellow Angelenos experiencing homelessness; tourists visiting Los Angeles, who would like to further connect with & serve the Los Angeles community. The #HashtagLunchbag Love Wall lunch building experience will perpetuate further service driven activism & action oriented love, whether or not it is through the #HashtagLunchbag program. 
 
 
 
 A timeline of activities 
 
 The development of the application will be roughly 6 weeks, with the first installation to take place within 2 weeks following the completion of the application. We anticipate establishing locations for the wall to be temporarily installed, for three months at a time, beginning 6 months before the first official installation. We will be 18 months out for planning, so that locations have adequate time for preparation, and that the wall location calendar remains clear and organized.
 
 
 
 How the project will make measurable progress towards making LA the best place to â€¨CONNECT:
 
 The #HashtagLunchbag Love Wall is an extension of the Living Through Giving foundationâ€™s mission to not only make a positive change, but to also promote and further a positive culture. Los Angeles will be the first city to house a moveable wall of love, connecting people via both technology and social media, providing organized acts of love. Through social media, the #HashtagLunchbag Love Wall will be able to gauge the impact and interest of users via their reactions, levels of participation, and sustained engagement, such as social media sharing, social media liking, repeat Love Wall visits to the same community rotation or to a different one.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,
7085646086,LIFT-Los Angeles,LIFT-LA empowers low-income parents of young children to break the cycle of poverty through one-on-one career and financial coaching. We believe all families should have an equal chance to thrive.,"LIFT-LA hopes that through our work we will bring increased attention to the idea of prevention as part of the conversation surrounding homelessness in Los Angeles. With so many facets of the issue needing to be addressed, and a disproportionate number of Los Angeles residents sleeping on the streets, prevention can seem like an afterthoughtâ€”a less-pressing issue to be discussed at a later date. However, that later date will not arrive, and it is crucial to raise awareness around the number of families living on the brink of homelessness in L.A.
 
 
 
 If we do not help this population and provide preventative services and interventions, the number of people living in chronic homelessness in Los Angeles will only increase. In fact, according to the Los Angeles Times, from 2012-2018 L.A.â€™s homelessness rate surged a shocking 75%, from approximately 32,000 people to 55,000. Even worse, three out of four of those currently experiencing homelessness in L.A. are unshelteredâ€”living in cars, campers, tents, and lean-tosâ€”and comprising what is by far the largest number of unsheltered people in any American city. Coupled with rising housing costs, we fear this number will only increase unless we take effective and immediate preventative action.
 
 
 
 LIFT-LA knows that programs like ours are key to effectively implementing homelessness prevention, and we are continually seeking to expand our partnership networkâ€”engaging with other organizations throughout the greater Los Angeles area to create robust referral partnerships so an ever-growing number of Angelenos can access our services. Additionally, we recognize that it can be challenging for members to continue to make progress toward goalsâ€”or focus on coaching at allâ€”when they are struggling to find or retain housing. To this end, we hope to build relationships with housing services in order to offer a program that will ensure people not only get housed but stay housed, rather than falling back into homelessness. LIFTâ€™s holistic approach and robust programming, including access to direct cash resources, is vital in this fight to keep Los Angeles residents housed, happy, and thriving, and not just making ends meet.","LIFT-LAâ€™s holistic approach to career and financial coaching differentiates us from many organizations in the Los Angeles area. Our focus on personal and social/emotional well-being complements our career and financial skill-building so that members not only have the know-how to progress out of poverty and away from homelessness, but a community of support behind them that they can turn to in times of need. This support is crucial, as it reduces membersâ€™ toxic stress levelsâ€”allowing them to feel secure in the present and plan for the future. LIFTâ€™s many components, including our Career Pathways program, financial coaching, and educational partnerships, offer truly all-encompassing wraparound supports. This makes LIFT-LA a â€œone-stop shopâ€ for member needs, giving our members the flexibility to work with us despite their busy schedules.
 
 
 
 While there are many incredible organizations doing important work in this space such as Imagine LA, LIFT-LAâ€™s two-generation approach is what sets us apart. LIFT believes that parents are the CEOs and architects of their families, and when we invest in parents, we can impact two generations at once. We recognize that poverty is an intergenerational issue that is passed down from generation to generation, often dooming children of low-income families to remain in poverty. However, research shows even a $3,000 increase in parentsâ€™ income leads to benefits for their childrenâ€”including a 17% increase in the childâ€™s future earnings.
 
 
 
 One of the unique ways in which we approach the fight against poverty and homelessness is through our LIFT Family Goal Fund Program, which provides members with quarterly direct cash transfers of $150. These direct cash provisions provide our members with the financial slack that they need to pursue their goals, effectively buffering the effects of the toxic stress caused by chronic scarcity and â€œbuying backâ€ mental bandwidth to plan for the future and provide warm, responsive parenting. In partnership with Mission Asset Fund, LIFT also offers Lending Circles, a zero-interest, credit-building, small-dollar social loan program that fills the gap in banking services available to our members. The 52 members who participated in this program last year increased their credit scores by an average of nearly 40 points while building savings, paying down debt, and/or funding emergency expenses. These small loans also help LIFT members bolster their self-efficacy and increase their preparedness in the face of crisis by providing financial assistance in times of need. 
 
 
 
 Our third cash assistance program component, Member2Member (M2M), is a key part of LIFTâ€™s program and offers one-time investments by LIFT community partners or supporters for emergencies such as illness or car repairs. M2M focuses on bridging social capital by connecting members to those outside of their day-to-day social circles, allowing them to overcome isolation and find someone to turn to in times of need. This program reduces the impact of financial shock and helps members navigate moments of crisis, which too often lead to downward spirals of debt, eviction, and homelessness.
 
 
 
 We believe that these program components, which not only build financial and career skills but also bolster social connections and personal well-being, truly set LIFTâ€™s program apart. We hope to continue to expand LIFTâ€™s programming so we can touch as many lives as possibleâ€”leading not only in theory but in action.","To measure our programâ€™s impact and the progress parents are making, we collect data in three ways. First, LIFT uses Salesforce as our case management system to aggregate demographic data, progress towards goals, and track increased income/decreased debt. Second, LIFT administers four externally validated surveys every quarter to track social connections, self-efficacy, perceived stress, and financial well-being. Lastly, parents receive a feedback survey after every individual meeting to track program delivery satisfaction. LIFT compiles monthly workbooks using data collected to assess progress against a number of indicators (including personal, social, and financial metrics). Regular meetings between regional program leaders and LIFTâ€™s National Program Team open opportunities for the cross-pollination of ideas and exchange of real-time learnings, allowing us to emerge with services that deliver greater impact. The flexibility of our case management system also allows for rapid, seamless adaptations as our program evolves so that we can better understand the progress our members are making and how to tailor our program to member needs. 
 
 
 
 In terms of member progress, LIFT will define success using the following metrics:
 
 - LIFT will serve 400 families 
 
 - 80% of families who attend 4 or more meetings will report progress on 1 of 3 key measures demonstrating family economic security & well-being: 
 
 - 45% of families who attend 4 or more meetings will increase income

Due to a lack of affordable childcare, Irma was also unable to seek full-time employment. With only one parentâ€™s full-time income, the young family was experiencing toxic stress, at times unable to afford enough food.
 
 
 
 At LIFT, Irma and her coach worked together on a step-by-step plan to meet Irma's family where they were at, leveraging LIFT's wraparound services to provide the immediate supports she and her family needed to stay out of poverty and ensure they could afford to remain safely housed. Irma's coach referred her to food bank resources and helped her create a budget. Irma also enrolled in LIFT's Lending Circles and our community partner's EARN-SaverLife program, financial products that would help improve her credit score and encourage savings. Irma used the $150 in direct cash assistance she received every three months from the LIFT Family Goal Fund program to build her savings and pay down her debt. Since first joining LIFT, Irma has paid down almost $4,000 in debt and successfully increased her credit score by 99 points!
 
 
 
 Irmaâ€™s coach also connected her to quality childcare assistance so she could begin to look for a job. Irma participated in LIFTâ€™s Motherâ€™s Day Careers Workshop, which provided resume support, practice with mock interviews to learn interview skills, and tips on how to dress for success in the workplace. We are proud to share that Irma found a full-time position within two weeks of beginning to interview!

Los Angeles County holds nearly 10% of the countryâ€™s homeless population, and almost half of the people experiencing homelessness for the first time this year cited loss of employment or financial strain as the primary cause. Families arrive at our offices in the Pico-Union neighborhood (where one in three individuals live below the poverty line) with an average annual income of $18,000 and an employment rate of 30%. Over 90% of these families, who we call members, struggle to make ends meet, facing multiple barriers to moving out of poverty such as limited job skills and a lack of childcare, strong supports, and social networks. While there is no â€œtypicalâ€ LIFT-LA member, 98% of our members identify as people of color, and over 80% identify as Latinx, meaning that their journey out of poverty is complicated by racial bias, language barriers, and wage gaps. Additionally, many of our members are single parents, often single mothers, who struggle to balance work, education, and childcareâ€”teetering on the brink of homelessness.
 
 
 
 LIFTâ€™s program directly serve members, empowering parents of young children to build greater self-sufficiency. Members work with a rigorously-trained Master of Social Work student coach to develop personalized goal plans, working together over a two-year period to set and achieve S.M.A.R.T. career and financial goals to help keep them out of homelessness and away from poverty. Through career coaching, members connect with employers in high-growth fields, accessing soft job skills such as resume writing and hard field-specific skills and training opportunities.
 
 
 
 We know, though, that these skills alone are not enough to keep families out of homelessness. Poverty is isolating and many families lack a social support system to turn to in times of need. That is why coaches establish trusting relationships with members to pursue goals and build confidence. In fact, last year 85% of members reported that LIFTâ€™s services helped bolster their personal well-being. Through workshops and member-focused social events such as our annual Holiday Fiesta, members create stronger community and social ties with each other by sharing resources and building social capital. 
 
  
 
 LIFT wants all people to have access to everything L.A. has to offer. That is why our holistic model empowers parents with the tools they need to overcome the toxic stress associated with chronic scarcity, which has lifelong impacts on whole families: lowered executive functioning skills, shorter lifespans, and higher risk for disease. Last year, 61% of members reported reduced stress and 90% of members made meaningful financial progress in which the average income increase was $625/month, or $7,500 a year.

7136676533,LA Forward,"LA Forward activates a rising generation of Angelenos to join social justice movements that are striving to transform Los Angeles into a fair, flourishing place for everyone.","The great challenge of a project like the LA 101 guide isnâ€™t external opposition. Itâ€™s the need to balance deep knowledge about local government and how the policy process works in practice with the imperative to keep things accessible to someone whoâ€™s just asking questions for the first time.
 
 
 
 Thatâ€™s why we are staying away from the traditional encyclopedia model â€“ a printed or PDF format book â€“ and following scaffolding and popular education approaches to generating knowledge and mastery.
 
 
 
 Rather than release the entire guide at once, weâ€™ll regularly roll out new sections, so that the information is a digestible snack or meal, not an overwhelming all-you-can-eat buffet.
 
 
 
 Weâ€™ll hire UI experts to design an interactive website that lets people use the guide however they preferâ€”whether thatâ€™s getting a quick answer to one question or gaining a comprehensive understanding of the local governmental system from top to bottom.
 
 
 
 The workshops will be in a series format, but theyâ€™ll be designed to allow people to attend without having participated in previous sessions. And every workshop will begin by asking what attendees what they already know and what questions they want to answer so that the learning is grounded in the wisdom and curiosity of the participants.","The closest thing to the LA 101 guide weâ€™re planning is the 200-page book, â€œLos Angeles: Structure of a City Governmentâ€ published by the LA League of Women Voters in 2006. Itâ€™s a valuable resource but takes a different approach from our project. Weâ€™re working to make information accessible by breaking it into bite-sized pieces and communicating via a variety of media, not simply a large PDF that works best as a reference guide. Our project will also cover the County government. And crucially, we will be building a media and public education campaign around the guide, including community-based outreach to LAâ€™s diverse populations. Our guide will also account for all the changes in government since 2006 and as an online publication, will be updated regularly.
 
 
 
 The most similar program to our public series of workshops is the Civic University conducted by the Pat Brown Institute at Cal State LA. Our program will cover some of the same material. What sets us apart is our plan to radically democratize access to knowledge of our democratic institutions by having an online component and not requiring people to travel to City Hall or Cal State LA. 
 
 
 
 Weâ€™ll hold workshops across the county in partnership with community-based groups. Some will be very basic introductions to government for groups that have had minimal relationship to policymaking, while others will offer sophisticated information to experienced grassroots leaders about the little-known aspects of the policy process. 
 
 
 
 Weâ€™ve shown our capacity to reach a wide public. The very first LA Forward ballot guide reached 10,000 people in 2016 without a marketing budget because of compelling content, great design, and strong relationships, especially a board and advisory council of respected, well-connected young civic leaders who acted as ambassadors, sharing the guide with their circles. We plan to draw on these lessons to make our LA 101 guide a success.","The goal of the LA 101 guide is to make Los Angeles a more civically engaged place by giving people the knowledge to participate in civic life.
 
 
 
 To succeed, at a minimum, our project will need to reach hundreds of thousands of Angelenos. We will carefully measure how many people see the guideâ€”through tracking traffic to the website, video views, social media engagement, and downloads, as well as the number of people who attend workshops. Our goal is that those people will mirror LAâ€™s geographic and demographic diversity.
 
 
 
 The ultimate definition of success is the extent to which the LA101 guide can increase civic engagementâ€”how many people are sending in comments on pending policies, calling elected officials, showing up to council hearings, meeting with the staff of elected offices, joining neighborhood councils, volunteering with advocacy groups, voting and getting their friends to vote, especially on local candidates and measures.
 
 
 
 Itâ€™s difficult to assess causation in a place as large as Los Angeles but we will create surveys to ask workshop and online participants about their behavior and that of their social circles to see how it changes from before their contact with the guide to a year later.","* Professionals to research, writing and editing the guide's content - $25,000

 Ben and Jessicaâ€™s story illuminates how that works in practice. Living on the Westside and raising two small children, theyâ€™d been civically disconnected before 2016. Working for a solar energy company and a UCLA autism clinic, theyâ€™d assumed things were on track to get better nationally and locally. Their only form of civic engagement was voting in major elections. And while they used LA Forwardâ€™s ballot guide for local and state propositions, their attention was on national issues. 
 
 
 
 Jolted by the 2016 election, they knew they wanted to get involved but they didnâ€™t know how. After a few frustrating attempts at involvement with local chapters of national groups, they came to a LA Forward house party about Civics101 and decided to become LA Forward members. At first, they felt like they didnâ€™t know what they were doing. But they were glad for the community, including people with more civic experience. They went from attending marches to registering voters at marches to actually empowering the parents of their kidsâ€™ classmates to gathering hundreds signatures for a key ballot initiatives. They joined LA Forwardâ€™s core leadership team and lead our coalition-based work to decriminalize street vending statewide and actually build homes for the homeless.
 
 
 
 They found a sense of purpose and community. They were empowered to educate and organize their friends, co-workers, and fellow parents. One result of this new engagement was to help people like Marisol, a street vendor and activist in Boyle Heights, to finally be able to earn a living without fear of harassment and deportation, to know there was a chance her sonâ€™s school might be fully funded, that her homeless neighbors would finally have a roof over their heads and a bed to sleep in. Even though LAâ€™s great geographical and social distance still separates these familiesâ€”they havenâ€™t met in person and may never do soâ€”their lives have been intertwined for good, to their mutual benefit.
 
 
 
 *Names have been changed","Our main partner, LA Voice (a congregation-based community organizing network), has nearly 60 member groupâ€”churches, synagogues, and mosquesâ€”around the county encompassing an incredible diversity race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic levels. Weâ€™ll draw on their extensive relationships and our own to identify and work with small local groups to do joint workshops. 
 
 
 
 LA Forward is the project lead because of our successful experience with creating and distributing ballot guides, but we will work closely with partners throughout the process. Community-based partner organizations will be crucial to the success of the LA 101 project, especially as we conceptualize, create, and distribute the guide to an audience that matches LAâ€™s tremendous racial, religious, and class diversity. Weâ€™ll consult them about the topics to prioritize and consider their ideas and feedback as we design the guideâ€™s visual appearance. Weâ€™ll collaborate to find and select translators for the linguistic communities they serve.
 
 
 
 The lionâ€™s share of funding for community-based partners ($15,000) will be dedicated to workshops theyâ€™ll co-host. 
 
 
 
 In addition, weâ€™ll seek to collaborate with university centers for the study of LA at Cal State LA, LMU, USC, UCLA and more. LA Forwardâ€™s Executive Director is connected personally to these university centers through his experience earning a Ph.D. at USC focused on Los Angeles.

 We envision LA101 as a tool that empowers Angelenos to join a conversation with elected officials, decision-makers, and local government over the policies that will determine the future of our region. 
 
 
 
 Without knowledge of how local government works, thereâ€™s no possibility of impacting it. By illuminating the workings of the city, the guide and workshops will pave the way for greater involvement. When Angelenos learn effective ways to voice their views, theyâ€™ll have the confidence and know-how necessary not only to participate in local elections, but to do the mundane and crucial civic work of calling elected officials, showing up to council hearings, meeting with government staffers, joining neighborhood councils, and volunteering with advocacy organizations.
 
 
 
 Our Plan
 
 
 
 Instead of dropping the entire guide at once, weâ€™ll release it in installments starting with the most basic information and moving to increasingly detailed and sophisticated sections on the workings of local government. This approach, inspired by the agile software development model, will allow us to produce results quickly and to adjust our ongoing work in response to feedback. It will also provide multiple opportunities to garner public attention.
 
 
 
 LA101 will cover:
 
 * Major elected and appointed officials and what they do
 
 * The different city departments, what theyâ€™re responsible for, and how they impact your life
 
 * How the public can effectively weigh in throughout the process including how to reach elected officials, the art of public comments and lobby visits, fundamentals of building relationships and coalitions
 
 * And much more...
 
 
 
 We envision the guideâ€™s main home as an interactive website that lets people use the guide however they preferâ€”whether thatâ€™s getting a quick answer to one question or gaining a comprehensive understanding of the local governmental system from A to Z. 
 
 
 
 Installments will also be rolled out as serialized social media posts, and weâ€™ll create a Vox-style video about the first installment to publicize the guide. To reach an audience that matches LAâ€™s diversity we will collaborate with a wide variety of community groups in our network to hold workshops across the county. Weâ€™ll hire a grassroots, community-focused PR firm to pitch stories on LA101 to regional, neighborhood, and ethnic media.

7139155615,USC Annenberg Innovation Lab,We're creating and leveraging media + popular culture to increase census awareness + participation in LAâ€™s hard-to-count (HTC) and historically marginalized communities leading up to the 2020 Census.,"Since we only take it every 10 years, 2020 will represent the first time many people in the HTC groups will take it and because the data collected works in the background of our democracy, many people believe it doesnâ€™t matter to their lives. These factors are not unique to 2020, but this count will be set against a backdrop of unprecedented social and political polarization, bad actors, media fragmentation, government distrust, further heightened by the potential inclusion of the citizenship question, which cumulatively will increase the undercount of marginalized communities, further distorting flows of money and power. Additionally, the introduction of the first-ever digital census coupled with institutional challenges to the Census Bureau (persistent underfunding exacerbated by the 2019 shutdown) have created the perfect storm of opportunity to both suppress the count and question its legitimacy once completed.
 
 
 
 As if these conditions werenâ€™t daunting enough, we see three additional key risks: 
 
 
 
 Federally-funded census media outreach will not begin until January 2020; they will be constrained contractually, culturally and politically.
 
 Most civil society organizations lack capacity to create or distribute digital media and lack experience in combating disinformation.
 
 Philanthropy is engaged but has yet to spend significantly to counter the unique and cumulative forces leading up to the 2020 census.
 
 
 
 The gap leaves our information ecosystem vulnerable to attack and squanders valuable time to do foundational census education before April 1, 2020. The urgency to exploit this opportunity to build the movement now has never been greater. Count the Nation is the leading entity using a transmedia approach to creating and sharing content that harnesses popular culture to counter disinformation and create a movement around being counted that makes it as cool as it is important to take this 10-question survey. 
 
 
 
 We believe that compelling transmedia and a decentralized structure that elevates and amplifies authentic peer-to-peer messengers holds the ability to combat the knowledge void that exists around the census and to create the movement (taking a page from The Dreamers) to BE COUNTED. Our tagline is #ICount and we are focusing messaging on how unlike voting, every single resident gets the chance to exercise their voice to say â€œIâ€™m hereâ€ and call on representation that the constitution guarantees them. 
 
 
 
 There is no doubt that compelling media will change the course of the 2020 census.","We see anyone who is working for an accurate count as on the same team. The vastness of the undercount cannot be solved by any one group or from any one vantage point and as such have made strategic partnerships with both the US and CA Census teams along with front-line NGOs and niche media makers who operate in one or more of the hard-to-count groups we are focused on. 
 
 
 
 Having said that, we do believe that our agility and our unique expertise and orientation towards radical innovation, along with our network of media making and sharing experts position us as the strategic leaders for census media. Our collaboration with Data & Society Research Institute to understand real-time threat vectors to mis and disinformation is also a unique attribute of our strategy. The news syndicate that we are creating also has a pronounced differentiation from other traditional media organizations, it has one goal: increased self-reporting starting April 1, 2020. 
 
 
 
 Though many organizations will be needed to ensure a good count, none are building the content development strategy that Count the Nation has created. Federally-funded census media outreach will not begin until January 2020; they will be constrained contractually, culturally and politically. Most civil society organizations lack capacity to create or distribute digital media and lack experience in combating disinformation. Philanthropy is engaged but has yet to spend significantly to build understanding and counter disinformation.
 
 
 
 Our strengths lie in our deep and diverse skills across media: we have decades of award winning experience in news development, scripted entertainment, social media, amplifying social impact strategies and disseminating information that reaches audiences where they consume media and supports the creation of content from within marginalized communities.","The Census Bureau is targeting a self-response rate of 60.5%. CAâ€™s goal is to far exceed this. Our singular goal is to help CA do just that, knowing that the media, social spread and movement we create will cross all state borders. To meet this goal, the tangible metrics of success we have set are: 
 
 
 
 - Generate $60-70M in donated media
 
 - Secure commitments from showrunners to develop integrated content - across 6-10 properties - to inform and activate audiences.
 
 - Generate engagement rate of 15+% per post starting in 2Q19-3Q19 and grow to 30% in 4Q19-4Q20.
 
 - Generate 250-500k views per Influencer posts starting in 2Q19-3Q19 and grow to 1 million views minimum in 4Q19-4Q20.
 
 
 
 Additionally, we are: 
 
 - Creating a network of senior advocates to support showrunners in including census content in their programs
 
 - Developing earned media opportunities; sharing census related ideas and data with news organizations 
 
 - Nurturing creative-hacking communities in 5-10 cities across the nation; in partnership with the US Census Bureauâ€™s Open Innovation Lab","Content Creation + Digital Activations: 65,000

 Our funding model is focused on medium-large donations from individuals and philanthropic organizations that understand the importance of the census from a political, monetary and/or data standpoint.

A industry game-changer, ELH was the first high school drama in English with an all-Latino cast, creators, and writers and born out of the recognition that Latino audiences in the US are underserved and fatigued by their stereotypical representation in film/television. 
 
 
 
 The ethos of ELH: to be addictive AND thought-provoking on a social level matches the DNA of CtN. The team behind ELH used research & meaningful partnerships with >25 local & national non-profits to inform the development and production of the show. Connecting to the community and â€œon-the-groundâ€ experts helped them and will help us keep a finger on the pulse of what is most important to the audience and what will compel HTC groups to participate in the census. Through these partnerships, the show was able to thoughtfully cover important issues that were deeply impactful to their audience.
 
 
 
 The show also created a robust, multi-platform extension that allowed fans to take direct action on social issues featured. For instance, ELH partnered with Voto Latino to do a comprehensive voter registration campaign in the show and online in advance of the 2016 election season. One fan later posted: ""I am currently waiting in line to vote because of East Los High."" This method of creating content that is compelling, accessible and actionable is key to our ability to reach the breadth of HTC communities with authentic messaging. 
 
 
 
 ELH has 4 yearsâ€™ worth of summative evaluation data that demonstrates the showâ€™s significant impact on viewers. During the 1st month that ELH aired, more than 27K people clicked through to Planned Parenthoodâ€™s website from eastloshigh.com, and direct traffic to StayTeen.org (a website that informs teens on sex, relationships, and birth control) increased by 53%. Most notable from the research was that transmedia was the most effective format of narrative presentation, significantly over and above all other formats in educating participants about condom use.","Wise Entertainment and Data & Society are key partners of Count the Nation.
 
 
 
 Wise Entertainment has a deep history of producing serialized content that lives and breathes the intersection between entertainment, social impact and civic imagination.

 (ii) Creating a library of video content by engaging a wide group of influencers to create short form content around select themes and messages, and create paths of action for audiences who want to mobilize on a personal scale (e.g. create their own content, take a pledge to be a census advocate in their communities). 
 
 
 
 (iii) Partnering with diverse civil society organizations, media creators, and technology companies to create large quantities of content optimized for digital spread.
 
 
 
 (iv) Planning block parties in collab with front-line entities to make filling out the census fun. At these parties, census advocates will offer assistance in filling out the digital or paper forms and will answer questions about the impact and perceived risks included in participation.

 Many times children, seniors and adults have expressed how beautiful the park is, and how they have never been to a park such as Grand Park or to downtown L.A. Many times the youths and seniors arrive down and out -- but once they finish the warm-up exercises, begin the day with a new demeanor and are transformed on this day with smiles and laughter.
 
 
 
 A lady from the Downtown Women's Center once said, ""We need to all finish the Expedition and finish exploring the Park -- we need to make it to the Fountain -- that is Grand Park's crown jewel!"" She arrived sad, tired and with junk food and walking very slow off the bus -- at the end of the Expedition, she was a different person -- smelling the plant life and setting aside her walker. She motivated everyone in the group to make it to the finish line - to the Grand Park water fountain. 
 
 
 
 Children from Telfar Elementary School have joined in the Grand Park Rangers Expeditions -- a school with one of the highest homeless populations in LAUSD. The Salvation Army Day Care-Skid Row brought children of families who live in shelters and of the garment workers.

Most of all, they enjoyed dipping their feet and splashing in the water -- this is ""their urban beach"" in downtown L.A.
 
 
 
 One 7-year old wrote in her journal from the moment she got on the bus from her community center in the Santa Clarita Valley to her departure from Grand Park -- ending her notes with a large ""Thank You"", ""I want to come back to Grand Park"". 
 
 
 
 A 6-year old arrived in his Sunday best- a black vest suit and blue shirt and completed the expedition in his shiny black shoes -- he and the kids from the Salvation Army Child Care Center had waited with anticipation to make their visit to Grand Park through the Grand Park Rangers program.

Maintaining the culture weâ€™ve established with this massive growth of team size and creating a unique experience for young AmeriCorps members that are interested in working in a nonprofit and youth development will be a challenge that we havenâ€™t yet faced as an organization. To overcome this challenge, we will focus on three things: 1. Bringing on a Managing Director of Programs that has experience supporting AmeriCorps members, 2. Leaning on our current culture and our teamâ€™s experience working with our college-aged team leaders in a part-time volunteer capacity, 3. And building on that experience with team leaders by utilizing our leadership teamâ€™s former experience in leading and supporting AmeriCorps members in a similar full-time capacity.","There are many incredible youth-serving organizations within LA. However, there are three things that we believe make us stand out. 
 
 First, our large-scale, city-wide program. In 2020, we will bring together over 300 young people annually, from 60+ zip codes for 22 Saturdays. The diversity and depth of program is a huge part of our appeal to participants. 
 
 Second, we have a different â€œend gameâ€ in mind. We are building critical thinking capacities and changing civic behaviors of our participants so that they may go out and make change from whatever â€œseatsâ€ they choose to sit in. We are not prescribing a specific path.
 
 Third is our commitment to continuous quality improvement. We prioritize evaluation, conducting innovative research that highlights youth voice, seeks out real-time feedback, and allows us to curate experiences for youth. We analyze survey data weekly to answer questions about how and why we are reaching outcomes. This allows us to provide more impactful experiences for all participants. If more youth organizations sought to truly understand their impact, we will all better serve LAâ€™s youth. Our approach to data could have positive implications for youth civic engagement across the city, and eventually the state and country.","We conduct formative, mixed methods program evaluation. Our evaluation focus highlights
 
 both the program process (i.e. quality of program implementation, youth participantsâ€™ program
 
 experiences) and program outcomes (i.e. youth participantsâ€™ developmental growth and learning). Through continued use of these measures, we aim to track longitudinal changes in the programâ€™s ten target outcomes:

 Using pre-program and post-program participant surveys, we expect to see statistically significant increases in the ten outcomes above.
 
 
 
 In addition, we are utilizing a mobile technology to collect information about youthâ€™s real-time experiences during the program. This methodology, called Experience Sampling Method (ESM), signals youth at random points throughout the program day with a brief survey that asks respondents about what they are doing and feeling in that moment. This approach provides us with data on the quality of program implementation and how youth are experiencing and interacting with program components.

 Retention of teens/high school age students is a barrier - especially those teens that had not already set their sights on pursuing a STEMM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math and Medicine) to become successful health or STEMM professionals by the 7th grade (e.g., doctors, researchers, nurses, engineers, or scientists). Experience has shown us that expecting teens to wake up early on a Saturday morning to attend class (let alone a STEM class), or an activity not involving sports, watching TV, YouTube or social media, can be a lot to expect of a teen -- especially without engaged or concerned parent(s).
 
 
 
 While we recognize that competitive youth sports with its leagues and traveling teams have long been an exciting draw for youth, especially youth of color, most especially under-represented and under-resourced youth, we have been surprised to learn that participation in youth sports has been declining. Yes, while interest and opportunities for youth engagement in STEM learning have increased -- providing a unique and exciting opportunity for CDU Pipeline Programs to engage, educate, and inspire a 'new' group of youth, toward health professional and STEMM careers (e.g., sports medicine or sports analytics). 
 
  
 
 What is our strategy for overcoming our student retention barrier? Incentives -- offering incentives throughout the program to encourage youths' consistent program attendance, personal achievement, and his/her desire to remain in SSA II long enough to tangibly benefit from educational opportunities that promote, support and help sustain educational achievement. 
 
 
 
 Offering incentives also mean providing opportunities for peer recognition and rewarding 1) individual student achievement and overcoming challenges, 2) teamwork in class and 'on the field,' and 3) meaningful rewards for meaningful competition. Incentives will include attending the professional football game; student scholarships, and the ""famous"" SSA II Prize Box - where each week, the top two students in each class pick a prize from Prize Box.

 The core of our program is driven by quantitative assessment data obtained from each student. Students will be evaluated at the beginning of the 8-week Human Anatomy and Physiology STEMM-focused session to gauge their subject content knowledge. Upon completing the eight-week programmatic session, students are given a post-test that is directly aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards curriculum in which they were actively engaged. (Annually, SSA II includes two other 8-week sessions; Marine Biology and Plant Life, Physical Science and Engineering).
 
 
 
 The assessment data is analyzed and used to determine which students may need additional educational support (i.e., weekly tutoring services). Also, the assessment process provides SSA II staff a benchmark of student capacity and knowledge on the subject matter. Qualitative assessments are also conducted using student and parent surveys, student research, and presentations.","*Staffing*

 *A Parents Story*
 
 I am considered â€œfirst generationâ€ at King/Drew Medical Magnet High School of Medicine and Science. It opened in 1998 and is where I began my journey in what is now called STEM. My four children currently attend SSA II, and they enjoy learning about the human body, science, and math. SSA II has had a major impact on them -- I see the difference it has made in each of them.
 
 
 
 I didnâ€™t have an interest in STEMM until it was introduced to me at King/Drew High School. As students, we would go across the street to Martin Luther King Hospital as part of our curriculum. There, I was assigned to Emergency/Triage (ER), working hands-on with patients and doctors. In 2001, my junior year of high school, I was asked to be an SSA tutor, tutoring 3rd-4th-graders in Biology (also a great interest of mine). The students were very interested as well. Some subjects were fairly new to a lot of us, but being in SSA made you want to go into medicine.
 
 
 
 Though I excelled in track and football, I could not continue playing. My parents wanted me to attend the magnet school and focus on my schooling, rather than sports. Today, I am still somewhat in the medical field serving as a Wildland Firefighter, where I also save lives.
 
 
 
 I took this season off to focus on my children and their education. SSA was the first step. I knew that whenever I had kids, they would come to SSA. SSA II prepares youth for whatâ€™s ahead -- educationally, for careers, and life.","Marcedes Lewis, currently an American football tight end for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL), played college football for the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), earning consensus All-American honors, and was recognized as the top college tight end.

By harnessing the power of aerodynamics, we will create innovative system architectures that can actively refuel battery power on aircraft, electric vehicles and transportation services operated by civilian, city, and government entities.",['Central LA'],Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"Skywalker is led by the vision of Founder & CEO, Jomar Mendoza, a first-generation student of immigrant parents from Colombia. Like many other first-gen students, his family has been a source of inspiration to pursue higher levels of education being that many of his uneducated family members to this day hold janitorial cleaning positions including his 78-year-old grandma. As a youth in high school, juggling honors classes, varsity soccer, and youth mentorship programs, he too assisted with the family business by cleaning churches and facilities at odd hours of the morning. Ironically, it was during these darkest hours that emerged some of his brightest/impactful ideas. 
 
 
 
 Mendoza, who earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University and completed a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering (Triple Concentration in Aero/Fluid Dynamics, CFD, and Propulsion) from the University of Southern California (USC), is now completing in May 2019 a second Master of Science degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from the USC Marshall School of Business, Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. While pursuing his undergraduate and masterâ€™s degrees in engineering, Mendoza completed over 10 internships spanning companies from Cummins Inc., GE Aviation, Praxair, General Motors Ford Motor Co., and United Technologies Research Company (UTRC). Additionally, Mendoza spent several years as a full time Systems Engineer at Northrop Grumman where he supported CFD modeling and analysis on the development of NASAâ€™s James Webb Space Telescope program and other private military defense systems. 
 
 
 
 While an intern at UTRC, Mendoza was one of the 17 scientists in the Computational Aerodynamics group that designed the worldâ€™s first working BLI aerospace propulsion engine (https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/aeronautics/bli/) alongside NASA, MIT and Aurora Flight Sciences. At the close of 2017, Mendoza launched Skywalker, a R&D engineering start-up with the vision of impacting the world of human transportation by adapting BLI methodologies to the automotive and public transportation sectors.","Although this proposal is solely to fund the developments of Skywalker, there are some potential research partnerships as follows:
 
 
 
 - United Technologies Research Center
 
 - NASA
 
 - MIT
 
 - USC Viterbi Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering Department
 
 - LA Metro
 
 - LA Department of Transportation
 
 - Ampaire (LA Based Electric Commercial Aircraft Manufacturer)
 
 - Mullen Technologies (LA Based Electric Vehicle Manufacturer)
 
 - Westport Innovations
 
 
 
 The LA Metro has the second largest bus fleet in North America with nearly 2,500 buses while majority of these buses run on the Cummins Westport ISL-G 8.9L. Although these compressed natural gas (CNG) engines help reduce emission and greenhouse gases, the future is electric. With Skywalker, our aim is to assist in building â€œZero-Freeâ€ emission fleets of public transportation by implementing battery powered buses with this regenerative electric energy. This also aligns with other city urban mobility programs such as LA CoMotion that is looking to start â€œa revolution that is set to transform every city in the world, large and small.â€

There are three main types of electric propulsion configurations including full electric, turbo electric, and parallel/series hybrid electric. Variations in the design would be based on the specifications and shape, however, all of which will need to meet the power requirement to complete the projected route or mission. Such battery technologies integrations are projected past N+3 (30 years) for 2-aisle commercial aircraft usage; however, the technologies and systems are ready for use today for small 2-8 passenger planes, electric vehicles and public transportation services.
 
 
 
 Therefore, many large government and private sector companies are conducting extensive research on advancement of battery technologies to meet the power density and energy output demands of the given system architectures. Such advancements will include the development of whole battery sources other than typical Li-Ion battery composition, which is common in full electric motor vehicles today and current battery choice for electric aircrafts such as the Airbus E-Fan.
 
 
 
 Continued research in advanced aircraft/automotive design and battery technologies (power density, fuel cells, nuclear) is necessary in order to optimize electric propulsion systems and meet propulsion requirements of various systems. As well as the development of intermediate regenerative electric energy. This leads us to the discussion of primarily structural changes that include the practical use of Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI). Boundary layers are regimes in the flow field where the flow equations are dominated by viscosity and create the majority of drag experienced by the boundary body. BLI is the process of ingesting the turbulent boundary layer developed along the boundary body into an electric propulsion system, which ultimately reduces the power needed to propel the aircraft/automobile resulting in the reduction of energy consumption and C02 emissions.
 
 
 
 We look to execute system level designs with this infused regenerative energy technology by using methods of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows. With the combination of commercially available CFD software tools and high-speed computers for computational efficiency, we look to validate our designs by the modeling and simulating the free-stream flow of the air fluid into our electric energy turbine. By setting attainable milestones and project timelines of our computational analysis and prototyping, we look to accurately project and track the progress of our project.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,Not Accepted,,Not Accepted,

We have already received a commitment by Big Sunday to provide sponsorship contacts and access to its over 40,000 volunteer database. The City of LA currently maps its dirtiest streets, and we plan to employ their data inform our routes to get the most bang for our buck, and to interface with law enforcement in ensuring our cleanup routes are safe to walk. LA Family Housing has agreed to provide best practices for street cleanups regarding the interface with the homeless population.

The more our residents get out of their cars and onto the streets, the more appreciation they have of the colorful tapestry of neighborhoods and people that make up the city. Social media has enabled large groups of like-minded individuals to explore our urban environments, walking hundreds of miles of the city. Walking leads to a belief in the value of public transit, quality public spaces, and clean streets. Frustrated by the amount of trash left on the streets and sidewalks, some of these people teamed up with friends to come out and do a series of impromptu trash pickups. On a Sunday in 2018, a small group of us cleaned about a mile and a half of Hollywood streets in about an hour and a half. Residents, business owners, and even passing motorists cheered the effort. Afterward, we asked ""how can we upscale this to cover a large portion of the city?"" Knowing there are thousands of L.A. residents who not only enjoy walking, but would likely pitch in to do a manageable walk that results in a mass citywide cleanup, it was clear that this was about creating a simple concept on a audacious scale. Using inspiration from the grassroots #UNLITTER or #TRASHTAG movement, and from the mass just-for-fun ""Great Walk of L.A.,"" we created the concept for a one-day organized trash pickup event, where nearly 650 miles of streets will be â€œunlitteredâ€ in just a few hours. Volunteers in teams will each walk one of 160+ 4-mile loop routes starting and ending at an LA Metro station. Using mobile technology and social media, UnlitterLA promises to be the biggest mass street cleanup ever attempted, and as a regular event, it can make a significant difference in the appearance of our city as well as the actions of our residents.

Four or five hours later, nearly 650 miles of streets will have been â€œunlittered.â€ Using GPS and mobile mapping systems, volunteers will have access to data such as restroom locations, trash bag drop locations, and realtime location on cleanup routes. Coordination with city/county sanitation departments and private trash collection firms will ensure that bagged litter is promptly removed. Sponsors and grant sources will provide funding and in-kind contributions of volunteer supplies, promotional items, and marketing of the event. A key strategy is to maximize exposure via social, broadcast, print, and online media to drive home the cultural change message that our residents care enough to come out and clean up, and that we should be more careful to avoid littering in the future. This effort serves all residents of the region, both directly through improving the quality of our surroundings, and indirectly by helping reduce harmful impacts on waterways.

The second component is emotional awareness focusing on providing youth with critical thinking skills, and the appreciation of non-traditional forms of success including the arts, innovation, outside-the-box thinking, fostering of new ideas without the fear of failure, and focus on the flexibility of universal skills. In career, youth will focus on career development by learning how to personally brand themselves, social media etiquette, networking, create a resume, partaking in career assessments, mock interviews and learning how to turn internships into full time jobs to start their career. Our Youth Entrepreneurship Training will help promote social and cultural identity, build a stronger sense of community, and give youth, especially at-risk youth, a sense of meaning and belonging. Recruiting and retention rates for local higher education institutions will increase thanks to our program as we will partner with local higher education institutes to have representatives come and make presentations and engage our youth about their respective institutions and programs. Youth that participate in this program are innovative, creative, community oriented, and hardworking. This program will help youth unleash their potential by connecting youth to resources and programs will create long-term Angeleno entrepreneurs in our great city.",,,Active,CREATE,,,Voting Period,
7960948140,Urban Encore Symphony and Singers,Urban Encore connects world-class musicians and emerging artists with underserved communities in L.A. We encourage caregivers and patients to perform and experience the healing power of music.,"1. Music was naturally therapeutic before there was the discipline of Music Therapy. Our advocacy for the healing power of music without a music therapist leading the workshop could raise some questions. 
 
 
 
  However, through recent scientific research, music has proven to be therapeutic regardless of the absence of a music therapist leading the therapy session. 
 
 
 
  Unlike the typical music therapy session where a single music therapist leads, our music support group workshop will involve several musicians who would perform music for and with participants, facilitate a group composition component, and other activities. 
 
 
 
  By emphasizing that we are not music therapists, but rather a support group, we hope to disarm any prejudice that may be raised against us.
 
 
 
 2. Death, hospitalization, and medical emergencies of the patients and their caregivers will likely be an emotional challenge. We will discuss this possibility with our young musicians and our clients to prepare them. 
 
 
 
  Additionally, we will comfort each other through open communication and by making meaningful music together. 
 
 
 
 3. Although Urban Encore is not opposed to using medicine, our workshops emphasize a non-pharmaceutical approach to reducing depression, anxiety, and building immune systems. 
 
 
 
  This will only be a problem for pharmaceutical companies if it becomes a mainstream cultural trend. We advocate for highly-trained musicians who have compassion and empathy to connect with clients. So in a simple sense we try to replace some unnecessary medicine with musicians. 
 
 
 
  However, we will not advise participants on their intake of medicine. All participants will be encouraged to discuss their medical needs with their physicians.","There are two L.A.-based organizations that advocate for the healing power of music: the Urban Voices Project and Street Symphony. The Urban Voices and Street Symphony are actively engaged with the homeless population. Street Symphony also performs for inmates in jails. 
 
 
 
 Urban Encore has also been actively engaged in working with the homeless population by collaborating in an eight-month project with the Urban Voices Project, Los Angeles Poverty Department, and other arts organizations based in Skid Row. 
 
 
 
 However, from its inception Urban Encore has implemented the extensive research on the health benefits of group singing. We have been consistently seeking to provide high quality and interactive music for patients with serious illnesses and caregivers in L.A.","Urban Encore, a new music organization, will consider itself successful if caregivers and patients facing serious illnesses show an improvement in their quality of life.
 
 
 
 We will evaluate the emotional, social, and physical state of the participants before and after the workshops for each of the 10 weeks during a ten-month period. If we see overall improvement among the participants we will consider our project a success. Additionally, we will use the information we gather as a benchmark for further projects that will involve improved changes to our workshop.
 
 
 
 The age and type of illness of the patients and their caregivers are purposefully placed at the end of the survey in order for these to not affect their answers.

Our goal is to empower musicians to give cancer, AIDS patients, and their caregivers a period of relief using a non-pharmacological approach.","['Central LA', 'East LA']",Lateral application (testing feasibility of a proven action/solution to a new issue or sector),"When I was in fifth grade my grandmother on my dadâ€™s side moved in with us. She had just been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.
 
 
 
 After a long day of work my mother would come home to take care of her needs with kindness. She cooked food that grandma could easily digest. My mother's heart was full of empathy and she never spoke a word of complaint.
 
 
 
 For the next six months our home was filled with the painful sound of agony, severe coughing, and spitting. My chubby grandmother turned into wrinkled skin and bones. One morning she passed away in her sleep. I was young but the pain was real.
 
 
 
 My dad, a tall, muscular Korean, cried in front of his daughters for the first time.
 
 
 
 I began to wonder what I, as a musician, could do to help patients and their caregivers after other people were affected by serious illnesses. 
 
 
 
 In the last couple of years I have been reading up on the scientific discoveries surrounding the benefits of interactive group singing among cancer patients and their caregivers. Most of the studies on this topic found that stress hormones were significantly reduced, and immune systems were boosted after just 30 minutes to an hour of interactive group singing. 
 
 
 
 I also discovered that Los Angeles boasts the largest population of musicians and artists in the United States. However, like most of the U.S., it does not have a cancer support choir.
 
 
 
 In response, I recruited several musician friends and went to the Los Angeles County hospital in October of 2018. 
 
 
 
 We filled the oncology/hematology units and chemotherapy rooms with music and made them forget about their suffering. Every time we went people felt better. 
 
 
 
 Their caregivers felt especially comforted. 
 
 
 
 On one occasion we were singing â€œCielito Lindo,â€ in Spanish, to a mother who had terminal cancer and her daughter who was taking care of her. They began smiling and humming with us until we sang the line â€œCanta y no llores,â€ which means â€œSing and donâ€™t cry.â€ At that point the caregiving daughter burst into tears. When my friend and I looked at her, she opened her arms to us, and we tightly embraced each other.
 
 
 
 This experience has repeated itself many times in the last four months. As a result, we founded Urban Encore Symphony and Singers.","Project Angel Food provides food for Communal Meals, a weekly food-pick up.

 To improve organizational efficiencies, we must invest further in technology upgrades. Last program year, we invested in a collaboration portal (Google Classroom) to support program delivery as well as ongoing Search Engine Optimization to drive more traffic to our website (helping with Fellow recruitment). We are now focused on increasing capacity in Salesforce CRM. Salesforce is an integral part of EnCorpsâ€™ daily operation and maintaining clean, up-to-date program and evaluation data is a priority. David Taus, our San Francisco Bay Area Program and Recruitment Director, has been serving as a Salesforce Administrator and Trainer on the platform. This is not sustainable as the organization grows. We operate using the Salesforce NonProfit Success Pack feature which has limited features. Our plan is to invest in the full-capacity version which allows for more customization and outsource staff training.
 
 
 
 To grow staff capacity, which will lead to greater program and student impact, our strategy is to solicit more general operating/unrestricted support. This would allow us to expand our service areas and hire local Program Coordinators to cultivate regional education partnerships, assist in volunteer and full-time teacher placements, and perform program evaluation.","EnCorps is unique in its work. We recruit passionate, career-changing and retiring STEM professionals from the private industry into our award-winning Teaching Fellowship to â€œre-wireâ€ - not retire - to become effective teachers in the classroom and pass their knowledge to the next generation. Assistant Principal Deena Rodriguez explains, â€œIt's very difficult to find teachers who are qualified to teach STEM because they don't have the industry experience. The EnCorps program bridges the gap between the industry sector and education."" EnCorps Fellows have an average of 17 years of industry experience related to the subjects they teach and approximately 70% have a Masters or PhD degree in a STEM subject. 
 
 
 
 EnCorps differs from education systems, such as universities and programs like Teach for America, that approach teacher recruitment and training from the university undergraduate perspective and typically guide first career seekers into teaching. We leverage a non-traditional, highly skilled teacher pipeline because we are committed to the core belief that solutions uniting multiple generations are a key to access, equity and human progress. EnCorps Fellows, who are advanced in age and career stage, are given exceptional opportunities to meaningfully engage and participate in their communities, to continue learning and expanding skill sets, and to impart critical knowledge acquired over decades of hands-on work in the STEM industry to students (the future workforce). These former STEM professionals turned Teachers are innovating classrooms by integrating their workplace experiences and resources into STEM curriculum which has in turn, impacted student awareness and access. School partners report that EnCorps Fellows contribute to increased student excitement about STEM (96%) and increased academic achievement in these essential subjects (94%). Students report being more aware of STEM career opportunities after working with an EnCorps Fellow for only one academic semester (81%). 
 
 
 
 We collaborate with organizations working to reduce teacher shortages and improve STEM learning opportunities for students. In 2011, EnCorps became one of 28 organizations invited to join the national consortium 100Kin10 (now with 250+ partners), tasked with enriching Americaâ€™s classrooms with 100,000 excellent STEM teachers by 2021. EnCorps partners with Project Lead the Way and the Linked Learning Alliance and is a member of the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity and California STEM Ecosystems. We partner with County Offices of Education and institutions of higher education for teacher credentialing who share our commitment to recruiting people to join the teaching profession in order to address one of the worst teacher shortage crises in modern history.
 
 
 
 EnCorps has been recognized for its work: we received the US2020 STEM Mentoring Award (2016), Annenberg Challenge for Innovation in Technology Award (2017), Silicon Valley Education Foundation STEM Innovation Award (2017), Carl and Roberta Deutsch Foundation HALO Award (2018), and was a Semifinalist for the Drucker Prize (2018).","EnCorps will develop and sustain a pool of 50 STEM professionals who are in the pipeline to transition to teaching in Los Angeles during FY2020. Candidates are selected based upon rubrics measuring competencies for successful teaching in underserved urban schools, including achievement in STEM fields, resilience and grit, personal responsibility for student achievement, growth mindset, and cultural awareness and sensitivity. 
 
 
 
 Output 1: The 50 selected Fellows will be placed for pre-credential volunteering (guest teaching), impacting a total of 2,600 middle and high school students in a math, science, or career-technical education classroom.
 
 
 
 Output verification: Program Directors will manage Fellowsâ€™ placements at our vetted partner schools in Los Angeles. The number of students impacted by Fellows during pre-credential volunteering will be recorded by participating host teachers and EnCorps Fellows. Students and host teachers will be surveyed at the end of each semester regarding the impact of having a Fellow guest teach and volunteer in their classroom; we track outcomes such as % of students whose grades improved; % of students who are more interested in pursuing a degree or career in a STEM field, and % of students who understand better why science, technology, engineering and math matter in their life.
 
 
 
 Output 2: EnCorps will create and deliver over 50 hours of in-person and online professional development for Fellows during the program year. Professional development topics include strategies designed to engage students, classroom management, project-based learning in STEM, as well as Common Core and NGSS to build teaching skills. 
 
 
 
 Output verification: We will provide Fall Institute, Spring Institute, Summer Residential Institute, Professional Learning Circles, and extensive online resources and trainings available via Google Classroom. We will track Fellowsâ€™ participation in professional development through event registration, taking attendance, and monitoring Google Classroom assignments and activities. Participation is logged in Salesforce and documented in Google Classroom. 
 
 
 
 Output 3: At the end of the grant period, Fellows will be eligible to begin CTE teaching or intern math or science teaching while completing their single subject credential. 
 
 
 
 Output verification: We will monitor Fellowâ€™s credential completion and teaching placements, which is tracked in Salesforce, while continuing to provide professional development opportunities to support their growth as an educator. 
 
 
 
 EnCorps is committed to continuous review and improvement. Executive and program staff review program implementation quarterly to assess status against Key Performance Indicators, and at the end of the program year to help plan for the upcoming year. These data points are critical when revising and evaluating EnCorpsâ€™ recruitment strategies, levels of support for participants during pre-credential volunteering, and relevance of professional development as preparation for full-time teaching. 
 
 
 
 EnCorpsâ€™ program directors collect quantitative and qualitative data to measure program success, tracked in Salesforce. Currently, quantitative data includes records of participation of EnCorps Fellows in the classroom; attendance and participation of Fellows in each phase of teaching preparation; and the number of Fellows who transition into teaching positions. Qualitative data including surveys and interviews regarding the efficacy of Fellows in the classroom, are conducted at the end of each academic semester with students, principals, and district and charter management organization staff.
 
 
 
 EnCorpsâ€™ Director of Development, Grace Howard, will provide Quarterly and Annual updates regarding program outcomes. Also, in FY2020, with school partners we aim to compile and compare the outcomes of students in EnCorps teacher classrooms. The measurement that we will use will be the comparison of standardized test scores of students in EnCorps math and science classrooms v. school averages v.

We anticipate a drop in usage once they learn more about the harm single use plastics have on the environment. Also, we know how many plastic water bottles and sodas are being purchased each day, prior to the installation of the 5 water filtration stations. We will reassess after the students have the option of free clean water to see how many plastic water bottles are being sold per day.","The filtration units cost $3500 each on average. We seek help purchase 25 of these to support 5-10 schools. If the students raise a significant amount then we can purchase up to 50 of these units (average is 3-5 units per school). The remaining $12,500 will be used for Habits of Waste staff members to organize the workshops and identify the next schools.",We seek to fundraise with the help of local business surrounding the schools we will be serving. Everyone deserves clean drinking water in a large city like Los Angeles and local businesses will support this as we have already seen with the research done at LA HIGH.,"['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']",Our #LAGREENTEEN program teaches inner-city Angeleno youth about environmentalism and reduction of single-use plastics through a 4 part workshop. LA HIGH is the first school we are working with (March & April 2019). We seek to install clean water filtration units throughout LA High school and plan to repeat this with other LAUSD schools as well.

The idea was born when seeing like-new crayons be discarded by restaurant staff at kid-friendly restaurants at a rate of 150 million crayons/year. Crayons do not decompose as they are made of paraffin wax. In addition, the norm of tossing still good crayons worsened the ""throw-away society"" Americans are known for and kids were watching this happen over and over again. We had to re-think trash as our landfills were overfilled and trash had to be transported miles away from Los Angeles via train. We started to pair local underserved Title 1 schools with participating restaurants who agreed to collect the still good crayons for us. Local schools would pick up over 2500 crayons per month for homework and a variety of art projects. Crayon Collection broke a cycle of waste that was longstanding and many people never considered and instilled a new mindset. Next, we challenged LA based artists to create projects ideas using just crayons so students could have robust art education curriculum, another program that was cut in public schools. The Crayon Collection model was an example of how we can do better but thinking of solutions. It was at these very same restaurants that we noticed full glasses of water with plastic straws in them that no one ordered. We realized that this was a ""habit of waste"" that needed to be changed as ewll. We spearheaded the ban on plastic straws and cutlery in the iconic City of Malibu, which ignited worldwide change against single-use plastics. We launched a new program called Habits of Waste to address more environmental issues including plastics and many other things. Then #LAGREENTEEN allows us to reduce dependency on plastic water bottles in LAUSD schools by providing another solution - filtered water units. Creating a new â€œeco-normalâ€ consciousness that focuses on stewardship of the environment and support of nearby communities in need. Now, we are inspiring environmental action & career building for low-income students who have less access to environmental opportunities than their affluent counterparts.",We are not collaborating with anyone.

8030434832,Partnership for Los Angeles Schools,The Partnership for Los Angeles Schoolsâ€™ mission seeks nothing less than to transform schools and revolutionize school systems to empower all students with a high-quality education.,"The Partnership is absolutely committed to transforming our schools so that they are equipped to prepare students to apply, enroll and succeed in college and their subsequent careers of choice. However, we face a major barrier that exists separate from those within our schools: the attitude held by many students and families that college is for other people. For example, when asked to identify the highest level of education that they aspire to attain, only 52% of Partnership K-12 students chose the option of a four-year college degree or higher.
 
 
 
 Typically, the attitude that â€œcollege is not for meâ€ does not stem from an aversion to a university education. Rather, many of our students see college as something unobtainable, a choice only available to other people. This default position is often influenced by a lack of exposure due to drastically-limited educational opportunities faced by parents and other adult family members. Often parents do not visualize college for their children for similar reasons, which can be exacerbated by financial constraints.
 
 
 
 The Partnership is determined that students and families operate from a place of empowerment and knowledge in which all children and young people are considered future college students, even if they ultimately decide to follow a different post-secondary path toward their career of choice. This commitment led the Partnership to launch our Parent College program nine years ago. Parent College has trained more than 8,000 family members to support their studentsâ€™ academic success at the primary and secondary levels, driven by a focus on college as a means to career success. University Day is an annual Parent College initiative.
 
 
 
 By expanding the K-12 College Compass program to all 18 network schools eventually, the Partnership seeks to establish a touch point with all 14,000 students and their families. The curriculum has a clear focus and connection to career as the â€œwhyâ€ that drives college preparedness. Beginning in kindergarten, students discover careers that appeal to them; as they progress by grade, they learn how their schooling builds knowledge and skills that can move them toward their career.
 
 
 
 The College Compass program encourages our students to think of a bachelorâ€™s degree as a means to access the full range of careers that match their innate abilities and interests. Over years of accumulated College Compass experiences, the program will promote self-identification within our students as future college students, while assisting their parents and family members to visualize them in the same way.","As discussed previously, the Partnership is unique in that our organization is by far the largest in-district school turnaround operator managing LA Unified schools and seeking to influence transformation from withinâ€”rather than outside ofâ€”a district setting. The Partnership is also unusual in that our extensive, direct school-management experience is matched by deep expertise in systems-change work as evidenced by: direct advocacy with LA Unified leaders and elected officials; effective support of parent advocates; efforts in coalition with like-minded nonprofit organizations; and technical assistance and written resources, including policy briefs.","The Partnership will define and measure project success during the 2019-20 school year based on Partnership network students achieving the performance outcomes (below), each of which supports a LEARN metric. Most of these outcomes reflect annual increases of 3 percentage points, which is an accelerated growth rate compared to LA Unifiedâ€™s average progress.
 
 
 
 â€¢ The Partnership networkâ€™s Spring 2020 student proficiency rate in English Language Arts (ELA) will reflect a 3-percentage-point increase above the Spring 2019 ELA proficiency rate, as measured by annual Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment (SBAC) results. (The proficiency rate represents the percentage of student test takers whose SBAC scores fall within the ranges of meeting or exceeding the Common Core State Standards for their grade.) Baseline: 34%, Spring 2018 SBAC ELA results. Related LEARN metric: Proficiency in English & Language Arts and Math.
 
 
 
 â€¢ The Partnership networkâ€™s Spring 2020 student proficiency rate in math will demonstrate growth of 3 percentage points from the Spring 2019 math proficiency rate, as measured by annual SBAC results.

In January 2018, the Lundquists extended their investment through a $35-million pledge over an additional ten years. During 2018, the Partnership received other important multi-year gifts including investments from the Ballmer Group, $15 million over five years; the Wasserman Foundation, $3 million over four years; and the Leonard Hill Charitable Trust, $2 million over two years. While portions of these gifts are earmarked toward the future expansion of our school network, the Partnership can also draw from the donated installments to fund project costs in excess of an LA2050 investment.","['Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness']","Each young personâ€”regardless of skin color or incomeâ€”has the right to graduate high school well-prepared for success in college and a subsequent career.

As part of building a college-going culture, all Partnership elementary schools are tasked with their students learning and remembering the year of their future high school graduation. This activity is a small way in which the Partnership establishes an expectation of college among our youngest scholars. 
 
 
 
 Successful college preparedness flows out of the Partnershipâ€™s school transformation programs. The Partnership believesâ€”and research supportsâ€”that resilient school principals with a clear vision are needed to transform schools, that effective teachers are essential to student learning, and that engaged parents are the most important force to their childrenâ€™s academic achievement. Our community partners provide tremendous supports aligned to the priorities of our schools and students.
 
 
 
 The Partnership's school transformation programs strengthen the ability of each stakeholder group to play their key role in promoting student growth. As a result:
 
 â€¢ The Partnership has succeeded in more than doubling our network graduation rate from 36% (2008) to 79% (2018).
 
 
 
 â€¢ The percentage of Partnership graduating seniors accepted into four-year colleges and universities has grown markedly, from 32% (2015) to 50% (2018).
 
 
 
 â€¢ Between spring 2015 and spring 2018, the percentage of Partnership students proficient in English Language Arts grew a total of 15 percentage points, from 19% to 34%, while math rose by 9 points (with rounding), from 14% to 22%. These increases are substantially higher than average LA Unified improvements over the same time period.
 
 
 
 The Partnership complements programs focused on building stakeholder capacity with a vibrant advocacy work stream dedicated to achieving the systemic changes needed for broad, sustainable transformation. In these ways, the Partnership continues to forge a pathway to ensure that in 16 years, members of the Class of 2035 will be fully-prepared to enter college.",Not applicable.,development@partnershipla.org,LJ Carusone,213-201-2000,[],[],[],[],Non-profit organization,"['Yes, in 2014', 'Yes, in 2016']",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,https://www.facebook.com/PartnershipLA/,@partnershipla,@partnershipla,https://www.partnershipla.org,https://youtu.be/LQBJxKL78Lw,"['LA2050 newsletter', 'LA2050 website', 'Social media']",51+ employees,No,,"['College matriculation rates', 'District-wide graduation rates', 'Proficiency in English and Language Arts and Math']",[],[],[],Los Angeles,"1055 Wilshire Blvd., Ste. 1850",26-1759681,Â Partnership for Los Angeles SchoolsÂ,California,90017,[],[],,www.partnershipla.org/donate/,,Charting the Pathway to College: the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools' College Compass Program,LA is the best place to LEARN,$1 million +,,"A college degree is a lifeline for the Partnershipâ€™s 14,000 network studentsâ€”just as it is for other marginalized students who call Los Angeles home. Among 25- to 34-year-old adults, those with a bachelorâ€™s degree have annual median earnings almost two-thirds higher than people with only a high school degree or its equivalent (U.S. Dept. of Education). The boosted earning power of a bachelorâ€™s degree gives students a way to significantly alter the trajectory of their lives, stabilize their families and re-energize their communities. 
 
 
 
 The Partnershipâ€™s college preparedness work has outsize importance because of our unique position as the largest in-district school turnaround operator working with LA Unified. As an independent 501(c)(3) organization, we partner under a Memorandum of Understanding with LA Unified to manageâ€”and systematically transformâ€”18 of the Districtâ€™s historically-lowest-performing schools (TK-12) in Watts, South LA and Boyle Heights. A staggering 94% of Partnership students qualify as low-income; our network enrollment is 89% Latino and 9% African American.
 
 
 
 Partnership schools stay within LA Unified by intent to incubate viable solutions that LA Unified then can scale to benefit all 500,000 District students. Based on our autonomy, we implement the Partnership's transformation model to confront the profound challenges common to high-poverty schools. Designed around best practices, our comprehensive, integrated programs develop and strengthen expertise in key school stakeholders, including principals, teachers and parents, and promote deep connections with community partners. This increased capacity is leveraged to enhance our studentsâ€™ academic accomplishments and social-emotional well-beingâ€”the foundation for college success.
 
 
 
 The Partnership collaborates with nonprofit partners, including College Track and College Spring, to provide our high school students with year-long, targeted supports in such areas as college entrance exams, applications and financial aid. Each fall, all five Partnership high schools hold on-site College Fairs where seniors can meet directly with admissions officers from 10 to 20 four-year institutions. Every spring, the Partnership holds University Day, an activity-packed field trip that brings 1,000 network students and family members to a local university for what is often their first direct experience of a college campus.
 
 
 
 The Partnershipâ€™s new K-12 College Compass program fosters a college-going culture through a series of grade-level experiences, shared expectations and regular communication carefully-designed for students and their parents. A cohesive K-12 curriculum accompanies a customized family tracker and student self-tracker, which promote investment in the studentâ€™s education and progress. College Compass also helps students visualize themselves as future college students, and families to envision them similarly.

Research from the Census Bureau itself concluded the question will significantly depress census participation, especially among immigrants. L.A. will be one of the regions most adversely affected by the citizenship question. The county is home to nearly 3.5 million immigrants, over 35 percent of the countyâ€™s total population. Many of these immigrants live in mixed immigration status families that are extremely apprehensive about providing any information to the federal government because of fears that their census responses will be used against them. The mistrust and confusion already created over the addition of a citizenship question will make it more challenging to motivate residents to respond, resulting in low levels of participation, inaccurate population numbers, and ultimately, inadequate resources for the region that may not be corrected for another decade.
 
 
 
 The Census Bureau will also rely on the internet as the primary response option, which is particularly problematic for California. Access to broadband (high-speed) internet will determine how convenient an internet response will be for an individual. Many hard-to-count populations in L.A. County have limited access to broadband internet. 
 
 
 
 Ultimately, our county is primarily at risk of an undercount because of its large number of hard-to-count residents. California is home to an estimated 16.2 million hard-to-count residents. Over one-third of those residents (5.2 million) live in the L.A. region â€“ approximately half the county.
 
 
 
 To counteract all of these challenges, L.A. County needs as many â€œtrusted messengersâ€ as possible. Community-based organizations working with L.A. Countyâ€™s diverse populations are the best strategy to provide reliable information about the census. Some local organizations will also host census action kiosks where residents can complete the census online and access high-quality, verifiable information on the census and the benefits it provides to local communities. Involving these organizations is the charge of the L.A. Regional Census Table. We are working to achieve full coverage of the county, which is why we are recruiting co-conveners for the Westside and the South Bay.","Based on our research and conversations in the field, there has never been a collaborative effort to organize nonprofit organizations around census outreach in L.A. County â€“ ever. The City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles are partnering on their census outreach efforts in the Los Angeles County Complete Count Committees, and they jointly designated the L.A. Regional Census Table the County as the Community Stakeholder Subcommittee.
 
 
 
 Advancement Project California designed the L.A. Regional Census Table to complement the outreach efforts of the state and local government, as well as philanthropy. Many local organizations will receive grants from foundations in L.A. County, and perhaps some of the funding for outreach provided by the State of California. Whatever the funding sources, outreach efforts MUST be connected and coordinated as components of the same campaign to effectively count all of L.A. County.","Across all government, private, and community efforts, we believe it is possible to enumerate all residents in the county. At a minimum, however, the L.A. Regional Census Table is striving for increased census participation in L.A. County, with a goal of at least 75% participation. In 2010, L.A. County saw a 2% dip in its participation rate, to 73% from a 75% rate in 2000.
 
 
 
 Furthermore, Advancement Project Californiaâ€™s goal for the L.A. Regional Census Table is that participating organizations: 1) build their membership bases, 2) connect with organizations across geographies, populations served, and/or issue areas to better solve regional issues in the future, and 3) create a stronger nonprofit infrastructure in L.A. County that can improve opportunities and conditions for residents who have been politically, economically, and socially marginalized.","All funding for co-conveners is used for the activities described in item 9.

 If you look up â€œredistrictingâ€, youâ€™ll see that, officially, itâ€™s the process by which state and local officials use the census data to draw representative boundaries for federal, state, and local districts.
 
 
 
 Unofficially? 
 
 
 
 Redistricting is how people in power keep themselves in power. 
 
 
 
 Itâ€™s historically been one of governmentâ€™s most secretive, closed-off processes, where from one day to the next, you could wake up in a different school district, or in a reconfigured congressional district that splits your neighborhood down the middle. 
 
 
 
 At that training session in 2012, several residents were already set up at our computers, navigating a redistricting web portal we created to help them draw draft district lines that made sense for their area of the county. Our newest attendee - the lady in the doorway - didnâ€™t know how to use a mouse. She was probably who several bureaucrats had in mind when they expressed skepticism about our training sessions: â€œRedistrictingâ€™s too hard for the general public to understand.â€ â€œWhy should we do outreach?â€ â€œLeave redistricting to the map makers and the elected officials.â€ 
 
 
 
 This is the attitude that Advancement Project California and our partners confront â€“ and combat â€“ all the time. It fuels our passion to blast through the barriers many communities, especially communities of color, face to increased civic engagement. Through community-centered projects like the Los Angeles Regional Census Table, we make government accountable to residents, and connect government and democracy to residentsâ€™ everyday lives.
 
 
 
 Toward the end of the community session, the older woman approached our staffer again. He was prepared to help her with another function related to using the laptop. But all she wanted was his opinion about which map she should use, of the three she'd created, when she eventually gave public testimony.","Five organizations currently collaborate with Advancement Project California (APCA) in the L.A.

 SELA Collaborative",https://www.AdvancementProjectCA.org/donate,AdvancementProjectCA.org/sign-up,The Los Angeles Regional Census Table,LA is the best place to CONNECT,$1 million +,"The Los Angeles Regional Census Table is THE gathering space for nonprofits to collaborate so every resident in L.A. County is counted in the 2020 census. While the government will perform outreach, research and previous censuses prove that the most effective messengers are local community organizations that residents already know and trust.
 
 
 
 The strategies for an accurate count are simple â€“ but effective. Organizations identify the areas to target, then deploy staff and volunteers to share information, make presentations, and hold cultural events, raising census awareness and motivating communities to respond. But to cover the estimated 5.2 million residents that are hard for the Census Bureau to enumerate, we need hundreds of organizations. Itâ€™s essential that organizations performing census outreach know whoâ€™s doing what, where, when, and how. Thatâ€™s the role of the L.A. Regional Census Table.
 
 
 
 Six lead organizations serve as census action hubs, each for a different region: Antelope Valley Partners for Health (Antelope, Santa Clarita Valleys), Long Beach Forward, Pacoima Beautiful (San Fernando Valley), L.A. Voice (San Gabriel Valley), SELA Collaborative (Southeast L.A. County), and Advancement Project California (Central L.A.). Winning the My LA2050 Grants Challenge would allow us to engage two more co-conveners to cover the South Bay and Westside.
 
 
 
 We meet quarterly, physically in each of our regions, but connected via audio/video technology. Each co-convener recruits dozens of organizations to the meeting for state/federal census updates, train-the-trainer sessions on engaging residents, and resource-sharing to maximize efficiency. 
 
 
 
 Our county has the highest number of residents considered â€œhard to countâ€ by the census. These include: racial/ethnic groups (American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Blacks, Latinos); people with disabilities; immigrants/refugees; LGBTQ persons; elders; the homeless; children 0-5; veterans; and those with limited English proficiency.
 
 
 
 Timeline
 
 
 
 PREPARE: Ongoing recruitment of organizations; develop outreach plans (7/2018-3/2019)

 The L.A. Regional Census Table mobilizes hundreds of nonprofits to engage residents in the census â€“ a critical and truly democratic means of civic participation. Through volunteer opportunities and cultural events, Angelenos will connect to play their part in allocating political power, and influencing billions for services like education, health care, and housing.
 
 
 
 The L.A. Regional Census Table will continue to have an impact even after the census. By building membership bases and developing community leaders now, we believe weâ€™ll see improved get-out-the-vote mobilizations, higher rates of voter turnout, and stronger relationships with local government.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,
8123619744,New America CA,New America CA promotes efforts that are locally grown and grounded in economic equity. We amplify the reach of change agents whose innovations provide transformative solutions within communities.,"One challenge to strategies focused on convening, connecting, and idea-generation is the tendency to attract the same types of attendees at every gathering-- what we call the â€œusual suspects.â€ These are the funding, civic and corporate leaders who are often keen to support efforts targeted toward low-income communities, and whose involvement is in fact crucial to their success. Also crucial to success, though, and far less common, is the participation of low-income people themselves. Community voice is paramount in generating the best possible solutions; as Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton recently quoted at an economic development conference, â€œNothing about us, without us, can be for us.â€ 
 
 
 
 Sometimes event organizers donâ€™t think to include the people their interventions are meant to serve; other times they hope to, but face structural barriers to accessing these communities. The same issues that contribute to income inequality -- like segregation, transportation, and siloed cultural capital -- can prevent even well-intentioned community leaders from designing inclusive gatherings. 
 
 
 
 This is why New America CA will work proactively to ensure that community voice is represented at RiseLocal LA, primarily through partnerships with community-based organizations that serve low-income people. We will ask these organizations to not only represent the people they serve but also to nominate specific constituents who can participate in the convening. Our pre-event research will also include constituent dialogues, to ensure that community voice is baked in to session design.
 
 
 
 Similarly, our nomination process will prioritize identifying innovators who are poised for success but are not yet deeply connected to traditional power structures. Our three years of running nomination and selection processes for the New America CA Fellowship positions us well for this -- we have honed a system that leverages the expertise of local connectors who know the people changing things at the ground level in their communities, and whose work is ready to move to the next level.","RiseLocal LA combines the best elements of New America CAâ€™s core competencies in talent development, communication, and action-oriented convenings, all in support of regional economic equity. Like a Fellowship, it will identify and invest in promising new innovators. Like the best storytelling, it will spread good ideas. And as a dynamic gathering it will connect participants and inspire them to action. While we think ours is a unique combination, we hope to learn from the rich array of organizations in LA that do each different piece of this well, including:
 
 -- Social Venture Partners LA: while not focused solely on economic equity, SVPLA identifies and provides financial support to promising local organizations, building the capacities of the organizationsâ€™ leaders along the way
 
 -- The Roddenberry Fellowship supports talented activists across a range of issue areas, providing capacity-building services that include effective communication. Like many Fellowship programs its decision to go deep with a small group of people by definition limits the number who can benefit from it; RiseLocal LA will learn which of its best practices have the potential to scale in the context of an event, to reach larger numbers of participants.
 
 -- LISC LA has a â€œChangemakers LAâ€ podcast series highlighting the people and ideas that are improving Angelenosâ€™ lives. While this strategy lacks the capacity to connect people and generate new solutions in real time, it could serve as a source of potential event participants.
 
 -- The region has a number of intermediaries that are leading multi-stakeholder efforts around economic equity, including Propel LA and SLATE-Z. We hope these organizations will serve as nominators and thought-partners. We also hope they will attend RiseLocal LA to connect, learn and collaborate with our featured innovators.","Over the long term, the efforts stemming from RiseLocal LA will help lower LA countyâ€™s Gini coefficient -- especially among marginalized communities -- bringing its income inequality in line with that of the rest of the country.

But Angelenos are bringing their signature creativity and hustle to beat it.

She was also a Fellow with New America CA.
 
 
 
 Suddenly, Erika started seeing changes in how Al Otro Ladoâ€™s clients were being treated. There was a spike in deportations of vulnerable undocumented residents, such as single parents and unaccompanied children. She was also seeing clients seeking asylum-- which is a right under law -- being systematically turned away. There were so many people in need, and few attorneys at the border to help them. 
 
 
 
 Erika knew she had to respond. She quit her job and moved to Tijuana, defending migrants during the day and sleeping on the floor of the Al Otro Lado office at night. Her only income was her New America CA fellowship stipend, which allowed her to live as a full-time volunteer. 
 
 
 
 Around this time, New America CA introduced Erika to Cecilia Munoz. Erika was planning a lawsuit on behalf of those being denied the right to seek asylum, and Cecilia connected her with former government colleagues who helped craft a congressional advocacy strategy. Ultimately Erika did sue, asking the court to declare illegal any actions not aligned with asylum protocol, and to introduce systems to get the government to follow the right policies moving forward.
 
 
 
 Since then, Erika has become a go-to expert for people looking for the latest news from the border. Leveraging her communications training from New America CA, she has written and spoken on behalf of migrants on issues from due process to family separation. 
 
 
 
 Over the course of Erikaâ€™s New America CA fellowship, her seed of inspiration grew into huge impact. And New America CA was there to accelerate it -- through connections to people who gave valuable counsel, a stipend when she didnâ€™t have a paycheck, and communications coaching that helped her maximize the impact of the stories she has to tell.

As of 2017, Los Angeles was the 7th most-unequal city in the country. A study by PolicyLink and USCâ€™s PERE found that people of color are disproportionately impacted by this growing wealth divide -- nearly 25% of African-American and Latinx residents are living in poverty. And research has shown correlations between this level of economic inequality and negative outcomes that impact all community residents, such as gender discrimination, crime, and worsening mental health. (Keeley, B., 2015, Income Inequality: The Gap between Rich and Poor, OECD Insights.)
 
 
 
 Fortunately, innovators from across LA are facing this challenge head-on. From incubators for startup founders of color to pathways to financial independence for survivors of domestic violence, they are generating local solutions with the potential to make economic opportunity available for all. 
 
 
 
 These solutions could benefit even more people than they already do. But social entrepreneurs doing great local work donâ€™t always have access to the networks and resources they need for their ideas to spread. RiseLocal LA will bring together both new and established voices in economic equity to:
 
 1. Connect local innovators with government, nonprofit and corporate leaders who can strengthen their efforts
 
 2. Surface and celebrate whatâ€™s working
 
 3. Generate new ideas and partnerships and provide implementation support, including two $10,000 seed grants and assistance from New America CA to get projects off the ground
 
 
 
 Hereâ€™s how itâ€™ll work: starting this summer, New America CA will launch a nomination process to gather the communityâ€™s recommendations for dynamic LA leaders who are innovating for economic equity. Weâ€™ll identify the people contributing the most promising new ideas, then invite them to share their work at RiseLocal LA, providing pre-event coaching on storytelling and communication to ensure that their messages pop.

Theyâ€™ll share their successes and dive deeper on the challenges that remain. Theyâ€™ll also combine forces around potential new projects to take their good work even further. 
 
 
 
 After the event, RiseLocal LA participants will be in the running for two $10,000 grants to support ideas and collaborations forged at the event. This seed funding will come with support from New America CA team members -- from project management to amplification through our networks-- to help get these new projects off the ground.

These challenges, and many others, are generally heightened in Los Angeles. The population size, complex diversity, sprawling geographic setting, historical trends, and other unique local demographic characteristics make Los Angeles the hardest-to-count county in the nation.

From friends, family, teachers, doctors, faith leaders, or neighbors, we all have trusted messengers in our lives and we use the knowledge they provide us with to inform how we think and act. Through supporting residents to be trusted messengers, the CGA program will address barriers to participation such as linguistic isolation and fear amongst our immigrant populations. Linguistic isolation will be addressed with CGAs who can speak languages other than English, particularly languages that will not have comprehensive assistance on the questionnaire, including Armenian, Farsi, Hindi, Thai and Khmer. Immigrants comprise an estimated 1.5 million or 38% of the Cityâ€™s population alone, and they may be less likely to respond to the 2020 Census due to concerns surrounding the potential addition of a citizenship question. CGAs from immigrant, undocumented, or mixed status households will be able to thoroughly answer the questions community members are asking and promote a sense of confidence and security in responding to the Census. 
 
 The primarily online self-response process presents another barrier in Los Angeles, particularly in the areas throughout the county that have low rates of internet access. For example, the city of Los Angeles has over 280,000 homes without internet access and about 47% of South Los Angeles households have limited or no access to high-speed internet and/or internet equipment. In an effort to bridge the digital divide for Census 2020, we have also developed Census Action Kiosks (CAKs), which are physical locations with regular office hours open to the public where they can comfortably and securely access information and/or respond to the 2020 Census on an internet-connected device. All kiosks will display the CAK webpage, created by the Cityâ€™s Information Technology Agency, which will provide users with the option to either access information and resources, or connect directly with the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s online 2020 Census questionnaire. The webpage and its contents will be ADA compliant and translated into various non-English languages. CGAs will staff these kiosks and provide digital literacy and language assistance to residents. 
 
 Los Angelesâ€™s diversity is one of our countyâ€™s greatest qualities, but it also presents a wide range of barriers to participating in the Census for our residents. CGAs will be dispersed across the countyâ€™s hard-to-count communities, providing in-language and in-culture outreach and assistance to address barriers specific to each member of our nuanced communities. The primary challenge for the CGA program will be to recruit and retain a diverse enough pool of trusted messengers from HTC communities that has the capacity to effectively address these barriers. We recognize that while many LA residents would jump at the chance to inform and uplift their community, they may not have the time or resources to do so. While there are many contributing factors, the County found that poverty is the most important component in identifying a community as HTC. Furthermore, we are seeking to recruit CGAs directly from our HTC communities and we want to support their participation. HTC communities often include our residents who work multiple jobs, speak a language other than English, and/or have a number of other reasons that make it more difficult for them to volunteer their time. This grant would allow us to provide some financial support for residents from hard-to-count communities who want to serve their community and become CGAs.","There are many organizations and agencies doing Census 2020 outreach and education within Los Angeles County, but we have started early and worked hard to be transparent and collaborative to reduce the chance of duplicative efforts. The majority of organizations intending to do Census 2020 outreach in LA County have been engaged with the Countywide Outreach Complete Count Committee (CCC) that we co-lead with the County. Additionally, the Los Angeles Regional Census Table (LARCT), which acts as the CCCâ€™s stakeholder table, is led by the Advancement Project California and convenes community based organizations from around the County. The City regularly updates the Countywide Outreach CCC and LARCT to ensure the partner organizations know how they can work with us on our outreach efforts, as well as how they can use our office as a resource for their own efforts. The CGA program will use these venues to encourage partner organizations to recruit potential volunteers and co-host trainings making the recruitment and training process easily adoptable by our community and County partners. Our aim is to create a collaborative framework, alongside other government agencies and community partners, to support and bolster the overall countywide 2020 Census outreach efforts.","We are defining and measuring the success of the overall Census 2020 Initiative by the accuracy of the count of Los Angeles in 2020. The 2020 Census data will be released in March 2021 to the states (for redistricting) and in December 2021 to the public. The State of California is intending to conduct its own California Housing and Population Sample Enumeration to assess the accuracy of the federal count. Community organizations and research institutions will also conduct assessments of the accuracy of the decennial count. We will be able to properly measure the success of our Census 2020 Initiative upon the release and assessment of this data. 
 
 For the Census Goodwill Ambassadors program, we are defining success by the programâ€™s ability to recruit enough CGAs to replicate the linguistic, ethnic, cultural, and geographic diversity of Los Angeles and by how well we staff Census Action Kiosks (CAKs) throughout the self-response period. One key metric for how well the CGAs serve the diversity of Los Angeles is by the languages they speak. We hope to have CGAs who can translate into as many languages as possible, prioritizing the languages that will not have full translation support from the Census Bureau. The presence of CGAs at our CAKs will be a central goal of this program. The kiosks will be where CGAs can provide direct assistance to residents who want to respond to the survey. This assistance will be in the form of digital literacy guidance by helping residents navigate the CAK webpage, translation services for informational resources and/or the survey itself, and providing additional information in-language and in-culture.","The intention for these micro-grants is to incentivize and support hard-to-count residents who want to become CGAs. We are still researching how to make this program fit the needs our HTC residents and are continuing to meet with and hear from the community in order to do so. Thus, the micro-grant distribution process for CGA activities will be tested during the pilot program, and improved and modified before the full rollout in November 2019. Beginning in March 2020, allocations will shift from education efforts to providing micro-grants for staffing CAKs and other CGA activities that translate directly into submitting Census questionnaires.

Mayor Garcetti issued Executive Directive 21 to direct City departments to assign liaisons to work with our office, develop Census outreach plans, and has invested $1.2 million to-date for Census 2020. Still, the potential addition of a citizenship question has caused fear and anxiety around Census 2020 during a time when overall trust in the federal government is eroding, namely among our immigrant communities. With more than 1.5 million immigrants living in the City of Los Angeles, comprising over 38% of our population, the story of Los Angeles is fundamentally tied to the stories of our immigrant residents. The Mayorâ€™s Office has been deeply engaged in efforts to integrate immigrants into the Cityâ€™s social, economic, and political fabric through the Office of Immigrant Affairs. To date, the Office has actively engaged more than 150,000 Angelenos through its work to coordinate city services, develop programs and initiatives that promote citizenship, civic engagement and advocate on local, state, and national legislation and policy. From the Mayorâ€™s Office of Immigrant Affairs to the incredible programs provided by local community organizations, Los Angeles comes together to support our immigrant neighbors and the 2020 Census is no different. We need to ensure that our immigrant populations are included in the nationâ€™s headcount, or the full story of Los Angeles will not be told in 2020.

Most directly, the CGA program will likely increase the rates of volunteerism across LA in 2020, and hopefully beyond. Additionally, the program will be responsive to residentsâ€™ needs by seeking to understand the variety of barriers to completing the survey and then recruiting and training trusted messengers to address those barriers. Since the CGA program will promote civic engagement, we hope it will increase voting rates in hard-to-count (HTC) communities by familiarizing them with government processes. Since CGAs will be encouraged to utilize social media for posting events and content, the program will foster local social media friends and connections. From distributing the funds that provide healthcare services and maintain our infrastructure, monitoring discrimination and enforcing civil rights laws, and informing businesses on where to build new locations, the 2020 Census count will influence life in LA.
 
 We are leading a pilot version of the CGA program in the Summer of 2019 designed to solicit feedback from the community, test its effectiveness, and iterate an improved version for 2020. We are seeking to engage the HTC populations in this program in order to improve their likelihood of response, and thus, the likelihood that they will be represented in the distribution of over $883 billion in federal funds, as well as political reapportionment and redistricting at all levels of government. Communities that are typically HTC include racial and ethnic minorities, renters, immigrants, residents living in poverty, children under 5, seniors, residents experiencing homelessness and English language learners. About 57% of residents in the City of Los Angeles live in hard or very hard-to-count census block groups.
 
 Recruitment for the pilot program will begin in April 2019, and by June 2019 we will begin training and commence early deployment. Our team is working with community partners to identify recruits. We are seeking approximately 80 CGAs over the span of 4 training sessions in HTC communities in South LA, Boyle Heights, Pacoima, and Harbor/Wilmington. In July and August 2019, all CGA participants will be responsible for hosting a minimum of 1 census community event.
 
 The results of the pilot will determine how we proceed with the rest of the program. September and October 2019 will be spent refining the program. From November 2019 through February 2020 we will host trainings and begin deployment. Once the online self-response tool is released by the Census Bureau in late March 2020, we will prioritize using CGAs to staff Census Action Kiosks, provide language assistance on-site, and share social media messaging. The Census Bureau will also provide live response data that we will utilize in real-time to deploy CGAs to areas that have a higher need. The CGA program will remain active until the end of the self-response period in July 2020.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,Under Review,,Moderation Process,

The City and community groups are in support and a solid project design emerged from the planning process. What is needed from LA2050 is a youth and community organizer who will rally community members to get involved in the project, as they are the most important aspect of the project. Community members will drive this project and are a critical component in planting and caring for the trees. Transforming the community and empowering them with education and tools to encourage their active participation in making decisions about their own community, about water and green infrastructure investments that are made in their community, and showing them how they can make their community healthier, is the ultimate goal. This goal requires Los Angeles to support Calles Verdes and for LA2050 to help us secure resources for a youth and community organizer.","There are a few wonderful urban forestry organizations in LA. They do great work but tend to cover limited geographic areas. There are also groups who do native vegetation and bioswales but they are limited in number and many are for-profit companies who have their own goals and are often one-dimensional in scope. We need more people doing this work if we are to transform LA. TreePeople, and Calles Verdes, is different in that the project incorporates a whole spectrum of elements: tree canopy; bioretention swales, asphalt removal, vegetated curb extensions, reflective parking lot surfaces, permeable pavement, and fruit trees. It is a comprehensive project that will produce multiple environmental, social, health and economic benefits; it is unusual for one organization to have the experience to drive and manage it all.","Success will be measured quantitatively and qualitatively.

 One summer in the late 1960's, a young Andy Lipkis learned at summer camp that smog from LA was killing the trees there and that the entire forest could be gone in 20 years. Deeply worried, Andy rallied 14 of his fellow campers, boys and girls, who worked for an intensive week planting a grove of smog-resistant trees. At the end of the week, as they boarded a bus to return back to the city, Andy wept. He was so moved by the experience but didnâ€™t think their efforts would make a difference or that they could stop the death of the forest. A counselor told the kids if they were inspired, they shouldnâ€™t stop â€“ that they should take their awakened passion and conviction back to the city and make a difference.
 
 
 
 One camper, Andy, did. And nearly 50 years later, he is still at it. He came home to LA and started planting and teaching people about the importance of trees. In 1973, he officially founded TreePeople. Since then, TreePeople has engaged millions of Angelenos in planting and caring for nearly 3 million trees, has given inspiration and birth to other environmentalists around the world, has developed innovative solutions to climate resilience, water management, urban forestry, and fire resilience, and in the process, has shown people that they can make a difference.
 
 
 
 TreePeople itself is evidence that every person can make a positive difference. The largest tree in the world, the California Redwood, begins with a seed so small that it is microscopic. Even after it has grown into an acorn, who would imagine that it could grow hundreds of feet tall? For every person who has a dream but feels too small and powerless to believe in their dream, think of the redwoods. Those towering beauties that were once too small to see kept growing, in spite of hardships, to provide the earth a multitude of eco-benefits and to offer peace and beauty and joy to so many. Like the redwood, every person has power inside of them to make a difference. Coming together with others to plant a tree can awaken that power.

Fruit trees, to create a patchwork fruit tree grove at residential homes will take place in early 2020. TreePeople will host demonstration workshops and provide guidance for each greening event. TreePeople will contract with Los Angeles Conservation Corps or another subcontractor on necessary construction elements, like asphalt removal. Infiltration rates, flood reduction, stormwater capture, water quality, GHG capture and avoidance, and both atmospheric and surface cooling will be measured against the baseline once installations are complete.
 
 
 
 (Post-project) The green infrastructure elements will be maintained for three years by TreePeople, in partnership with community members.

GIIFF showcases a variety of films and documentaries created by indigenous storytellers as well as panel discussions, workshops and cultural presentations. This annual festival reconciles, entertains and portrays the very diverse and brilliant cultures of indigenous people.",['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)'],Expand existing program (expanding and continuing ongoing successful projects),"Founded by Freda Sideroff, an indigene of the Garifuna people, in 2012 the Garifuna International Indigenous Film Festivalâ€™s (GIIFF) mission is to support the preservation of all indigenous cultures in the world through art and film. Upon its launching Garifuna International Indigenous Film Festival was recognized by Former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa who signed a proclamation declaring May 26th, Garifuna International Film Day in the City of Los Angeles and state of California.
 
 
 
 The Garifuna peopleâ€™s origins can be traced to West Africa. Brought to Central America by the Spanish, the epic story of the Garinagu begins in the early 1600â€™s on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent when two Spanish ships carrying West Africans sank off the coast of the Caribbean island of St. Vincent in 1635.
 
 The survivors swimming ashore found shelter in the Carib Indian settlements on St. Vincent Island and in other regions of the Caribbean and coastal Central America. They intermixed, intermarried and fused together becoming a single Black Carib culture, called the Garinagu. Afro-Caribbean, the â€œGarinaguâ€ culture and language are called â€œGarifuna.â€ 
 
 Migration has fostered a strong sense of identity. Garifuna celebrate their own unique heritage and language through music, which is characterized by guitar and drums, as well as religion and food, including Hudut, a coconut-based shellfish stew served with mashed plantains. Garifuna traditions, customs, and beliefs reflect the bond of community and respect for elders, both living and dead. UNESCOâ€™S Proclamation Masterpieces of Oral an intangible Heritage of Humanity issued to Garifuna Language, Music and Dance on May 18th 2001 due to an urgent need of preservation. The Garifuna International Indigenous Film Festival is expanding its vision to preserve, support, and share the culture of Garifuna around the world with our storytelling and film festivals.","We are a fiscally sponsored organization: California Center for Economic Initiatives (CCFEI) is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to creating the solutions necessary to respond to the greater economic development needs of underserved communities.

8454984584,In the Making,"In the Making is a community resource center located in East Los Angeles collaborating with open-minded, forward thinking organizations for the enhancement of all.","Currently, less than 3% of national health care spending, which has skyrocketed to over 3 trillion in the U.S., is spent on public health or prevention. People who are experiencing homelessness face a multitude of challenges, both emotional and physical, making it even more difficult for these individuals to get back on a path towards financial independence. Those who are experiencing homelessness do not have a place to call home. Housing insecurity, coupled with food insecurity, and exacerbated by mental illness and substance abuse, makes it even more difficult for those experiencing homelessness to live a healthy and productive life. Experiencing homelessness, whether it is on a one-time event or a chronic situation, means that basic essentials such as warmth, dry clothes, water, and food are not guaranteed. Without these basic human needs being met, even the most simple tasks become arduous ones. Not only is this issue a barrier, but it is also something our community center is passionate about addressing homelessness, from a prevention standpoint. 
 
 We emphasize the benefit of youth involvement in the community participatory work. Homeless youth can make great contributions to health-promoting policy through work at ITM. Through LA County workforce programs Archdiocesan Youth Employment Services (AYE) and Managed Career Solutions Inc. (MSC), we are able to offer paid internships and employment opportunities for low income and foster youth. In order to provide additional wraparound services for our youth, expanding our program to include a peer-led leadership model will be essential. Our strong mentoring and internship program at ITM forms an environment that is sustainable and promotes change for marginalized youth.","We provide items ranging from clothing to school supplies to toiletries for no cost or for prices that reflect the community's ability to pay in our flagship location in LA and online. We have hosted multiple 'boutiques' providing students with free clothing, shoes, and school supplies. We also provide referred clients with professional attire, free of charge. Additionally, we also make 'house calls' for individuals who need our help and have partnered with families and youth throughout LAUSD. Our support goes beyond our in-person and online store presence. We make each interaction individualized and ensure you feel supported every step of the way. Our primary customers are local community members and their families who live in LA but we have also offered emergency assistance to families affected by the LA fires and Hurricane Harvey. 
 
 We have begun to target and tailor our efforts to empower low-income and foster youth given the growing burden of homelessness in our community. ITM is a support system that is taking a preventive approach to structural inequalities. With the success from our boutiques in the LA area and the support from our core group of volunteers, we are able grow our E3 program to focus on offering support for all our youth interns. Our focus is on 1)empowerment, 2)employment, and 3)entrepreneurship. Since the launch of our E3 Leadership Program in January 2019, we already have 22 participants who are participating in community-based work and working to change health policy. Our work can be reviewed through our successes in empowerment, education, challenges encountered and challenges overcome. 
 
 We have diversified our revenue stream with swap meet sales at Santa Fe Springs, Rosemead, Vineland, and a local Hilda Solis sponsored event. Additionally, we sell to recycled, resale, consignment and thrift outlets such as Crossroads & Wasteland and online with Offerup, Mercari, Poshmark, Thredup, Letgo, and Craigslist. We also donate damaged items to GemTextâ€™s Clothes for the Cause program, which repurposes damaged clothing into textiles and other materials. Our revenue stream is matched with specialized services and volunteers, as well as large donations of goods from the Downtown Womenâ€™s Center. 
 
 Considering our mission of offering items free of charge to those benefiting most, as well as providing employment and support for at-risk youth, in addition to offering excellent products at very reasonable prices to those in the community, we believe that no other organization does work similar to ITM. Last year, our reach spanned beyond youth and families in the LA area and also included emergency assistance to families who were affected by last yearsâ€™ fires and Hurricane Harvey. We are also part of larger international networks, providing goods to the Philippines, Mexico, and Vietnam.","Our metrics encompass the values of our social impact enterprise. For our leadership program, key program evaluation metrics for success will be the number of youth enrolled in our paid internship program, percentage of youth who obtain a high school diploma while in our program, the duration of their employment with ITM, percentage of participants enrolled in college and/or vocational training, and percentage of participants employed after their ITM internship. Additionally, the number of volunteers and the number of collaborations with other organizations are key to our organization's mission. 
 
 Our partnership with USC Keck School of Medicine Department of Preventive Medicine and access to key health system navigators will lend credibility to our organization as well as provide a critical lens for understanding how our community work fits in the larger framework of public health and prevention of youth homelessness in LA county. Major themes in which we will continue to measure our growth include adults getting sufficient social & emotional support, rates of volunteerism within the organization, as well as attendance at our public events. 
 
 Additionally, with $100,000 of start-up funds to advance us from post-pilot to expanding existing operations, we can begin to cover capital improvements that are currently preventing us from opening our store. With the stimulus of partnering with LA2050 and winning this challenge, our projections for 2019 show a growth rate of 275.48%, with a net efficiency ratio of 39%, generating a sum total revenue of $245,000. We are excited about this wonderful partnership opportunity and how we can work together with LA2050 to make LA the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live.","Below we have listed our expenses and categorized them as operating expenses and capital improvements.

ITM had already demonstrated enough success in smaller pilot projects and pop-ups from 2016-2018 prior to moving into a bigger property where they could sort and sell more items. ITM is unique in that it is a hybrid with a business element that provides a revenue stream that covered a majority of operating expenses in 2018. Overall, ITM generated $65,250 in total revenue in 2018, with $48,650 being direct cash revenue from sales at Community Treasure events, pop-ups and online sales.

Her mother would always say ""go to sleep, so you can dream"" but this didn't stop Maribel; just hurt her self-esteem. Although Maribel grew up in more of a house than a home, she was determined to one day create a version of her own. As an adult she found a plot, and seed by seed was sown, little did she know it was a path towards something set in stone. Eventually this community gathering space was named ""In the Making"", as it was constantly evolving into something more groundbreaking. 
 
 Her goodhearted vibe attracted a hardworking tribe. 
 
 Paulette and Ed managed operations and finances, while Cindy got volunteers involved, including those who needed second or third chances. Jeanette and Jewelz coordinated logistics and managed social media handles, 
 
 Little by little, ITM was igniting sparks of curiosity like a well-lit candle.
 
 'Twas a magical day when Hayley arrived. She saw Maribel's vision right away and had never felt more alive! Keisha and Martin helped Hayley visually tell their tale, describing how this partner-SHIP was about to set sail. 
 
 She admired ITM for pioneering good work before getting paid. 
 
 Because of that, she wanted to share their story, naturally becoming their development aide. Bridging her passion for public health, with entrepreneurship and innovation, ITM was the perfect place to work and lead through incubation.
 
 Hayley and Maribel are one and the same, as both of their passions burned bright through dark times, guiding them like an internal flame.
 
 They marveled at how the organization had already grown, watering those very seeds that little Maribel had sown. What came to life was a safe space for low-income and foster youth, to gather in one place and learn how to speak their truth. Now on a path towards financial freedom and feeling so empowered, our youth are beginning to blossom into beautiful spring flowers. To bring the program to its full potential we need lights, and pipes, and more. We are just getting ready to launch our brand new ITM store! We can see the vivid vision of a more vibrant LA, In the Making is creating a better place to learn, connect, and play!","Since inception, In the Making has been a collaborative endeavor. We have leveraged an extensive network to provide key resources, paid employment, community events, and volunteer opportunities to East LA and beyond. Currently, ITM has already collaborated with over 50 organizations, most prominently LA county's workforce programs Archdiocesan Youth Employment Services (AYE) and Managed Career Solutions Inc. (MSC). MCS and AYE provide paid internships at ITM, getting our youth on a path towards financial independence. For many of the students in our community, they are socioeconomically burdened and have to balance academic challenges with financial ones. 
 
 For our youth transitioning out of foster care, we are partnering with Hayley Sayrs, a Masters student of Public Health at USC Keck Medical School Department of Preventive Medicine, to develop evidence-based practices, programs, and curriculum. A key aspect of this collaboration is to bring trauma-informed training and create a participatory action model, where the youth most impacted by the program also take part in developing the program curriculum. Hayley has already secured a Gehr Student Innovator Fellowship to spend 6 weeks this summer focusing on the barriers and opportunities for transition-age foster youth in our community and throughout LA county. Problem-solving and identifying key collaborators is of great significance when thinking about how to adequately address the growing incidence of foster youth who become homeless, as well as the prevalence of unsheltered and unaccompanied minors throughout LA county. 
 
 A long-running partner, the Downtown Women's Center (DWC), is one of our largest donors. The site has been a historic place for women experiencing homelessness to receive temporary shelter and direct services but frequently receive overflow items in their donation stream that are either unnecessary or inappropriate for the population being served. Our team saw an opportunity to keep items in the community, create job opportunities, foster volunteer opportunities, and create a space in East LA that targets youth and families. We feel strongly that connecting our community to key resources and programs as well as developing our own, is key to building a better and brighter future for LA. Additionally, any dollar spent at ITM is paid forward through our in-kind donations back to those experiencing homelessness and has a multiplier effect on the local economy.",inthemakingorg@gmail.com,Maribel Valdez,602-505-0960,"['Adults getting sufficient social & emotional support', 'Attendance at public/open streets gatherings', 'Rates of volunteerism']","['LA is the best place to LEARN', 'LA is the best place to CREATE', 'LA is the best place to PLAY', 'LA is the healthiest place to LIVE']",[],[],Non-profit organization,['No'],"@CountyofLA

 The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness reported that about one in ten young adults ages 18 to 25, and about one in 30 adolescents ages 13 to 17, experience some form of unaccompanied homelessness over the course of a year. Additionally, California accounted for 58% of unsheltered unaccompanied youth, with 33% of Californiaâ€™s foster youth currently residing in LA County (USICH 2017). 
 
 At age 19, more than 60% of foster youth are unemployed (CASA of Los Angeles). Additionally, less than 50% of foster youth graduate from high school and only 3% graduate from college (CASA for Los Angeles). 
 
 In 2018, we generated a steady revenue stream through our Community Treasure events and pop-ups as we prepare to launch our boutique this spring. We donate in-kind resources to our partner organizations who directly serve those experiencing homelessness on Skid Row and other vulnerable populations throughout LA county. Our paid internship program is complemented by wraparound navigation services to foster youth as they transition towards financial independence.

8542112964,International Association For Human Values,"We foster the practice of human values including a sense of connectedness, respect for all people and nature, an attitude of non-violence, and an ethic of social service.","The most important challenge that we would face is resistance from our target population viz. the police officers and community members from South LA (especially former gang members ) who may not be open to meditation practice. Whilst both groups could be skeptical about alternate methods of self-care to improve health & wellness, we will overcome this hurdle by engaging them through introductory sessions on nonviolence and meditation so that they can experience the benefits of the practices for themselves and feel inspired to sign up for the 8 week curriculum. Participants will also be provided with access to an online app after the training, so that they can integrate meditation practice easily in their daily routine.","Often solutions to reduce violence in such gang infested inner cities have included counseling by experts (usually from outside the community). Some cities also use arts and music therapy to allow for healing and solace. Although all these approaches are useful, they are not truly impactful as they do not sufficiently address the socio-emotional trauma that is associated with violence. 
 
 
 
 We believe that â€œhealth and wellnessâ€ is more than the mere absence of illness and disease. Wellness should be holistic and should address physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual aspects, thereby allowing true healing and blossoming of our unique inner potential. Our unique approach involves providing participants with powerful and proven breathing and meditation techniques to heal and transform trauma and pain. The SKY breathing exercise (cornerstone of our workshops) has benefitted millions around the world including veterans, inner city school youth, teachers, prison inmates and law enforcement agencies. Details are available here: www.skymeditation.org
 
 
 
 Technically, every yoga or meditation teacher is a competitor. However, we will be inviting such alternate health providers to join our certification training. This makes us unique as we are NOT excluding even those who maybe doing similar transformational work. 
 
 
 
 Another unique aspect of our program is that the graduates upon certification will be empowered to teach certain aspects of the nonviolence training and meditation techniques in their community. This ownership will ensure that the program is community driven and hence sustainable.
 
 
 
 The empowerment of the local community residents as â€œambassadorsâ€ or â€œagents of positive social changeâ€, makes our intervention unique as no external organization can ever solve any local issue.","Our program is based on the proven health benefits of the SKY meditation technique that have been published in several peer reviewed journals.

 In partnership with the National Police Foundation, we will measure the outcomes of our program (on all four levels above) through pre and post session surveys to assess improvements in resilience, mental health & wellbeing, and police community relations.

While the coming together of police officers and members of the community is not new, it was obvious that the infusion of the â€œself-discovery through meditationâ€ component was something new, and the genuine emotions that it created took the police - community relationship to a new and deeper level. The feedback received especially on health improvements from several participants after a few weeks of the training inspired us to continue our work with the LAPD.
 
 Inspired by the workshop, one of the participants travelled with us to India last year on a 7 day training expedition to deepen his understanding and application of nonviolence and meditation. He was a former gang member and one of Californiaâ€™s youngest juveniles who spent 32 years in prison. He shared with us that his childhood was full of trauma from living in South LA neighborhoods infested with gang violence. He had dropped out of school and had joined a gang, becoming even more violent as now he wanted to inflict pain on others. After completing our nonviolence and meditation training, he shared that it was important to heal childhood trauma of youth and families, to create sustainable transformation in society. Most importantly, after coming back from India, he has already organized a workshop on nonviolence and meditation for his community, family and friends. We are inspired by his dedication and he has helped us shape the curriculum of our Nonviolence Ambassador Certification program.","We are partnering with the National Police Foundation (a nonprofit educational organization) whose mission is to advance policing through innovation and science.

Each of the 15 officers in the team, will invite one member each from the local community (including former gang members, educators, victims of violence, peace activists and at risk youth) to build positive peace in the neighborhood.
 
 
 
 The first workshop (30 participants) will be held during May-June. The graduates of the program will organize the second workshop (during June-July) for another group of 30 participants. Each workshop will be conducted over 8 weeks, where participants will meet once a week (for 2 hours each) to develop leadership capacity for improving self-awareness, trust and teamwork, building authentic relationships, visioning and modeling change. Graduates will be certified through a â€œtrain the trainerâ€™ module in the last week so that they can subsequently promote the tools and wisdom of nonviolence in their communities and neighborhoods benefiting the local communities including children, youth, and families. These sessions conducted by graduates will focus on providing a regimen of proven breath and meditation exercises that are easy to learn and practice to reduce stress, overcome trauma, increase energy, improve mental health and wellbeing. 
 
 
 
 At the end of three months, 60 participants will be certified as nonviolence ambassadors in South LA. As a part of the certification they will need to organize nonviolence training to at least 50 people each. These training sessions will be scheduled across South LA at churches, schools, juvenile homes, prisons and police departments. So overall we expect to reach out to over 3000 people through our collective effort.

We recognize that there are many nonprofit organizations, particularly historic ones that are adapting to change, that do not have the resources to carry out long-term sustainability studies or planning. It requires a dedicated team, a functional board of directors or stakeholders, and frequently means putting off more immediate needs for long-term success. We intend to address this issue of bandwidth and overextension by breaking down sustainability resources into both short and long term, highlighting actions that can be taken now to immediately improve the functionality and viability of historic organizations. We will also work with our dedicated network of consultants, architects, grant writers, and volunteers to support and assist these organizations by following up regularly and making ourselves available for any questions during the ""open storefront"" period of this program.","The Los Angeles Conservancy, Esotouric, and the Los Angeles City Historic Society all do important work to highlight history across all of Los Angeles county. However, we feel that a lot of the work the city and affiliate organizations do recognizes the architecture and physical infrastructure of history, but not necessarily the preservation of organizations that inhabit or are dedicated to keeping that history. Though there are few organizations that inhabit their original historic buildings, but there are many that offer services that create just as much of an infrastructure as the physical building itself. We recognize that it is crucial to preserve buildings and historic architecture, but strongly feel that without preserving the organizations that make those places special the loss is just as great to the city as if the building had disappeared.","Over a one-year period, the Bob Baker Marionette Theater hopes to achieve the following objectives with the launch of its Department of Historic Sustainability: 
 
 
 
 (1) Create a network of historic Los Angeles nonprofits and organizations that are actively continuing to further their mission and provide programming across the city. 
 
 (2) Open up our storefront as a low-risk physical site for test programming, research, and skill-building. 
 
 (3) Create an archive and library of sustainability resources specifically geared towards historic organizations. 
 
 
 
 Success will be measured on both a small and large scale. On a small scale we hope to see historic groups using best practices in grant writing techniques, organizational infrastructure, programming, archival, and outreach. On a large scale level, we hope that priorities within the city and across all of Los Angeles pivot so that there are clear initiatives and resources available to help support history before it disappears.

Since the Theater's establishment, it has been a place where generations of Angelenos come with their family and friends to have fun and be inspired by Bob's lifetime of work, and the lifetimes of work that his team of puppeteers, costumers, and fabricators have contributed to make this vision possible. 
 
 
 
 Bob also focused on employing people from the nearby community at the Theater, leading to generations of kids in Westlake becoming involved at a very early age in the arts as torchbearers for a folk art in their community. One of our most senior puppeteers used to mow Bob's lawn when he was 7 years old and now is one fo the best marionette puppeteers on our staff who frequently hosts workshops for our staff and the neighborhood so they too can learn marionette puppetry. 
 
 
 
 Very few organizations exist that hold collective memories for the city of Los Angeles, whether they were the site of someone's first job or a family Christmas tradition for the last 50 years. The Bob Baker Marionette Theater has always dedicated itself to being a place that can be enjoyed across generations, as charming for a 5 year old as it is for a 50 year old. Increasingly, having identified the changing landscape of arts programming, the Theater has expanded its programming to include workshops for older kids and adults, and has begun partnering with other institutions across the city to illuminate Bob Baker's work in film, television, archives, and art.

Intrinsic to this project is also publicly accessible programs, conversations, and discussions to hear first and foremost what the people of Los Angeles value and want to see. 
 
 
 
 The timeline of activities will follow as such:
 
 (1) Bob Baker Marionette Theater will invite self-identified and community-identified historic cultural organizations for a series of round-table discussions to identify the most pressing and specific issues facing them today.
 
 (2) Over a 10 month period the Bob Baker Marionette Theater will make its storefront available, free of charge, for visiting historic organizations to take up residence and work collaboratively with the Bob Baker Marionette Theater and the surrounding historic community of Highland Park to research and encourage methods of sustainability and long-term success in their communities. During this process the Theater will share methods they have used to move and continue operations, and the Theater's Development team will lead workshops in grant writing and nonprofit sustainability.

8645461021,The Engineer Factory,The mission of the Engineer Factory is to increase the number of students from underrepresented populations (girls and students of color) pursuing higher education and careers in STEM.,"One major barrier that we face if pushing back the decades of negative narratives that tell students in underserved communities that girls, as well as Black and Brown students are not good in STEM. Our students are bombarded with stories about low test scores and limited resources. Moreover, low expectations for the students are pervasive.
 
 
 
 The Engineer Factory's strategy for overcoming this is four fold:
 
 
 
 1) We work with students EARLY and OFTEN. We introduce students to STEM as early as TK. We create early exposure to STEM, engineer design process and hands-on positive experiences. We call all of our students ""engineer"" so they become accustomed to hearing it. We would closely with schools to advocate the the increase of STEM activities in the classroom. We conduct professional development with elementary school teachers who are often ""STEM Skiddish"" and help boost their confidence to incorporate more STEM lessons into the school day. Moreover, we demonstrate that increased STEM activity can be achieved as well as continued improvement in English Language Arts and Math. Lessons can be integrated.
 
 
 
 2) Fear of math is generational. Often we'll hear our parents say, ""oh well, I wasn't good at math either"", almost giving their students a ""green light"" to under perform in math. We meet with parents to show them how their support and encouraging their students not to give in to the myth about math can make a world of difference. Moreover, we provide a cultural context that educates Black and Brown students that advance mathematics and many major advances in science were made by people of African and MesoAmerican descent. We remind students and their parents that STEM greatness is programmed in their DNA!
 
 
 
 3) Engineer Factory coaches middle and high school engineer competition teams. The teams promote team work and keeps the students excited and engaged in STEM. Furthermore, success in these competitions, even against more resourced teams, helps reinforce the students' knowledge that they are qualified, capable and confident students.
 
 
 
 4) We consistently hold high expectations for our students and constantly communicate that they can do ANYTHING that they put their minds to! We also show them how students in more affluent communities get support from parents, professionals and companies in their communities and let them know that we will provide them the same level of support!","There are other nonprofit organizations and summer programs that provide summer STEM programming. They also offer occasional STEM activities on weekends. The Engineer Factory is unique in that we are focusing our efforts on a designated geographic area and we consistently offer STEM programming year-round. Moreover, we consistently link math instruction with project-based STEM activities.","The Engineer Factory defines and measures success for our #MathSwag project as follows:
 
 
 
 1) We will gather baseline math data for each student at the start of the program (e.g. math grades, standardized test scores) and we will use the UCLA Math Diagnostic Test Program to conduct pre-program assessments for each student. We will gather year-end math grade and improvement on standardized test data, as well as have students complete the post-program MDTP assessment and document progress.
 
 
 
 2) Success will also be measured by student participation in the #MathSwag program as tracked by sign-in sheets and attendance.
 
 
 
 3) Success will also be measured by the number of volunteer hours provided by high school and college students as measured by sign-in sheets and attendance.
 
 
 
 4) Finally, Engineer Factory will conduct a pre- and post-program survey of students, parents and school teachers to measure their feelings and hopes for math success at their school.","Program Director (Oversees program, secure additional program resources, strategic planning, funder compliance and evaluation.)

He would dismantle phones and toasters just to see how they work. When in middle school in Inglewood, the son enrolled in the school MESA program in 2006. He had always been a quiet, ""Spock-ish"" kind of student and he found ""his people"" in the MESA program! The MESA Coordinator was amazing and took the students to engineering competition throughout the region. When at competition, the son would text his parents things like ""there are 8 our us...350 here"". The parents learned to understand that at these competitions that although there were 350 participants, the ""8 of us"" meant that there were a total of 8 African American and/or Latino student participants. Initially the students, often the only students from underserved communities would feel a bit intimidated...until they started winning! The Inglewood MESA teams from 2006-2008 won more JPL, Aerospace Corporation, Raytheon and Regional MESA competitions than any middle school in Southern California!
 
 
 
 This cohort of 26 Black and Brown students all continued STEM studies in high school and 100% went on to four-year colleges! Our son remains friends with many of these students who went on to earn degrees from prestigious colleges such as MIT, Columbia, NYU, UCLA, UC Berkeley, RPI and Olin. The majority of them graduated with degrees in engineering and other STEM majors.
 
 
 
 The Engineer Factory founders saw how confident and empowered these students were and sought to create an organization that would adopt the best practices of that MESA program to create a vehicle for encouraging more students of color to pursue engineering and STEM. We also witness many of the challenges and barriers that our son and the other students faced (e.g. math, professional mentors, need for STEM professional development for elementary and middle school teachers in underserved communities).

 How will you execute this program?
 
 
 
 Selecting the ten (10) sites: The Engineer Factory will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to identify ten (10) schools in South Los Angeles, Inglewood, Watts and Compton where less than 30% of students met math proficiency on standardized testing. 
 
 
 
 Create MathSwag Labs: The Engineer Factory will hire Math Lab Coordinators who will be responsible for offering eight (8) hours of math and STEAM programming at each school site, each week. Engineer Factory will recruit from the CSU MSTI students and the future teachers will be tasked with developing innovative and fun approaches to math instruction and implement hands-on STEM projects that reinforce math learning.
 
 
 
 Also, each student will take the UCLA Math Diagnostic Test Program (MDTP) pre-assessment. The report reveals individual student strengths and challenge areas. The coordinator will create an Individual Math Plan for each student, focusing on areas of need. The post-assessment will be administered at the end of the school year to measure progress. 
 
 
 
 The Engineer Factory has a volunteer program where dozens of high school and college students volunteer with the organization to help younger students with STEAM workshops and math program. High school students receive community service hours from their school and college students get experience in working with students. 
 
 
 
 Each of the MathSwag Labs will conduct at least two (2) Family Math/STEAM Nights where all students and families will be invited to participate. The events will hopefully support a culture of fun, STEAM learning and encourage families to engage in math activities at home. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The 500 students will be selected from underperforming schools in South LA and surrounding neighborhoods. The majority of students in the target neighborhood are Latino and African American and come from low-income households. 
 
 
 
 The program will operate throughout the 2020-2021 school year.

8687428777,Housing Corporation of America,HCA is a social service provider that coordinates onsite informal education programs in STEM and arts enrichment at over eighty affordable housing communities.,"The barrier to informal educational programs is often consistency with attendance especially in youth who are not starved for entertainment choices. This has always been a challenge with the type of informal educational programming that we provide; however, we have been successful at defining each propertyâ€™s unique sensibilities. For example, we are flexible in our programming to where we can adjust times and days for particular properties to A/B test what hours will attract the most residents. We also know that building friend groups among the residents is the most likely way to get kids to consistently attend classes. Through group texts, social, and team work projects we encourage the residents to build interpersonal relationships that will cement their wiliness to attend after school. Something we hope to thread into our programming is active parental participation since we know that this directly effects the attendance of younger kids.","The Columbia Memorial Space Center has been doing similar STEM club programs for youth from the inception of the center. Our concept was never to compete with their offerings but to partner with them to grow their programs into off site clubs which would expand their mission and ours. The focus of many affordable housing nonprofits tends to be government mandated social services. Housing nonprofits such as Abode also offer after school programming to their development partners; however, we differentiate from their model in that we concentrate on informal education and boutique programming (sculpture, animation, Etsy entrepreneurship, STEM) instead of generalized tutoring and social services.","Our main metric of success for this program is participation rates of youth and their parents, informal evaluation of emotional and self-esteem growth within STEM as carried out by our AEA certified evaluator Kate Cavijo who previously evaluated our program under a Disney Foundation grant. In our pilot program we conducted ""mid-season"" surveys with follow up from the evaluation team at the end of the program which utilized surveys, in person interviews, and phone calls to the parents of participants. In synthesizing this information, we discovered that parental involvement was paramount in success rates as well as insight into the growth of self-esteem among participants. Are focus in the following program will be to interview community members including property managers, parents, and participants both at the beginning, middle, and end of the program through phone calls in person interviews and town hall events that will serve as focus groups.","Personnel (include Staff Position and FTE)

With the support of our developer partners we can afford to cover any emergency incidentals along the way as they have previously helped fund three properties with this program in additional to the grant selected properties.,"['Access to LA2050 community', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","The Rocketeer Club is a free onsite after-school educational program for the residents of affordable housing complexes in LA County. The program offers high-quality experiences to transform young peopleâ€™s engagement, interest, and understanding of STEM. The year-long program engages resident youth in two-hour hands-on STEM activities, twice per week. Through activities ranging from robotics to 3-D printing and rocketry, youth explore the world of STEM in an inquiry-based learning environment.","['Central LA', 'East LA', 'San Gabriel Valley', 'San Fernando Valley', 'South LA', 'South Bay', 'Antelope Valley']",Post-pilot (testing an expansion of concept after initially successful pilot),"At a small property in Van Nuys, there was a community room that was being frequented by six tweens afterschool. Initially we wanted to offer homework help followed by a photography program but the tweens at this property had a hard time following a structured curriculum. Like most 12 year olds, they usually wanted to purchase the occasional snow cone and plow through our art supplies-doodling and painting quickly with no commitment to a long term art piece. So we were not sure the Rocketeer Club would be a huge success at this site. At first these same six kids-three boys and three girls-showed interest. Especially the boys when we started to teach robotics with LEGOs. Still as time progressed we noticed the boys were more prone to speed through a project and leave to go skateboard outside. The girls however stayed behind. The three of them eagerly sat through two-hour science days three times a week. They ultimately became friends and they held each other accountable. If someone didn't show up for class, then one would go knock on their door and remind them. They started to ask for even more chemistry experiments outside of the regular curriculum. The three girls formed a team, each taking on a different STEM persona- Genesis the doctor, Lotara the engineer, and Angel the biologist. In the end this trio were the only three to attend the field trip from their property. They stuck together on the bus, at lunch, and smoothly worked together in the Mission Control simulation at the Space Center. It would be endearing enough to say that this program created friends within an apartment community, but the true value of the Rocketeer Club was that it influenced the career possibilities for these girls. Together they empowered one another to role play what a life in a STEM profession would be. They imagined a world in which working with other females in a laboratory would be the norm. This program reminded them that together and with our facilitation they could create a safe supportive environment just a few feet from their front doors.","After a successful pilot program, the Columbia Memorial Space Center (CMSC) is partnering with the Housing Corporation of America (HCA) to provide hands-on, inquiry-based STEM programming to under-resourced youth, ages 6-13, by continuing and creating new neighborhood science clubs in low income housing properties in historically disenfranchised areas. The ROCKETEER CLUBS! will be based on the work of the CMSC and extend its mission to â€œignite a community of creative and critical thinkers.â€ ROCKETEER CLUB! will use unique STEM curriculum developed by CMSC to engage young people and build connections between the Space Center, science educators, working STEM professionals, youth participants and local communities in need.

Additionally, research in education has shown that relationships built in informal educational programs have a very powerful influence on young peopleâ€™s envisioning of their future, in some ways more than the activities of formal schooling. The primary goal of our nonprofit is establishing solid, ongoing, and consistent connections between the adult facilitators and mentors and the children within each community, using STEM activities as an anchor to gather youth together. The programs located at key HCA sites will leverage the rich, learner-centered curriculum developed by the Columbia Memorial Space Center, as well as our expertise in delivering this programming in affordable housing communities. The mission is to create a continual presence in the community and the young peopleâ€™s lives, providing different career paths in some of the fastest growing fields in the United States.

8711967679,Earios,Amplifying women's voices and stories by creating a podcast network built entirely by women. We hope to open up opportunities for women in an industry where they have been largely excluded.,"The largest barrier will be to create standout content in a market that is increasingly saturated. To combat this we want to hit the ground running with an aggressive marketing plan that emphasizes our bold, inclusive and unique perspective. Because podcasts helmed by celebrities are rarely promoted on their personal accounts, we are going to take advantage of our creatorsâ€™ built in audiences and work directly with them to integrate promotional materials for our podcasts into their personal accounts. We hope to align this kind of marketing with the creatorsâ€™ personal aesthetic and brand so their audiences are more inclined to engage with their content, rather than shoehorn the Earios brand overall to stand out unnaturally from their organic contentâ€”we believe this strategy differentiates us from other networks and offers flexibility to adjust to the response of the market. 
 
 Furthermore, the nature of our content itself and the need in the market that we aim to fix will help our content stand out on its own. By fostering shows that are highly produced and original with unique points of view, we escape the chumcast trap (two guys talking into a microphone).","There are a bevy of other podcast networks, but weâ€™re creating Earios specifically because currently there isnâ€™t a network out there that offers a slate of podcasts that even achieves gender parity, much less majority women. By creating this network populated by exclusively women, it will aim to correct the gross imbalance and will be a singular presence among its peers in the industry.","Like any media company, we will be keeping a close eye on download numbers for all of our shows and hope to make a profit with ad sales. The most important objective for Earios in the first year, however, will be audience engagement and growth. We want to create a community where our listeners engage with our hosts and each other, both on our individual show's Facebook pages and on the Earios website. We will also gauge each shows performance by how steadily their listenership is growing, not necessarily the initial number of downloads.","The grant money will primarily go toward our publicity push and hiring on additional audio producers and engineers to take our slate of shows into production for the first year. Amanda, Priyanka and Maria do not intend to take executive producer salaries in the first year. Here is a line-item budget:
 
 
 
 Budget to hire two additional part-time podcast producers: $65,000

 Equipment: $2,000",We intend to partner with an ad-sales company who will give us an upfront guarantee to be recouped through ad sales on our slate of podcasts. This amount will cover the remainder of our upfront costs and allow us to get Earios off the ground. We have several interested parties and hope to close a deal in the next few weeks.,"['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","In growing an entire media network we need support to continue to build out a podcasting studio, hire technicians, producers, purchase equipment and develop podcasts with our creators by hiring them support staff.","['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)', 'City of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a citywide benefit)']",Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"Itâ€™s hard to overstate the impact that podcasts have had on the modern media landscape. An example is Sarah Koenigâ€™s, Serial, which exposed shortcomings in the justice system and resulted in Adnan Syad having another chance to plead his innocence. On a more intimate note, a podcast called Spermcast that is produced by founder, Amanda, and will transition to Earios this Spring, has had a great personal impact on itâ€™s creator and community. At 39, with no man and a great desire to have child, comedian Molly Hawkey decided to take her destiny and fertility into her own hands and use a sperm donor to create a family. She chronicaled her journey by doing a podcast called Spermcast. Knowing that fertility treatments that she would likely need were expensive, she hoped that starting a podcast might help alleviate some of her cost. And she was right. Spermcast resonated with the community and Molly was able to raise a modest amount on her Patreon each month, which has helped her with medical costs.
 
 After launching Spermcast, Molly began receiving hundreds of long emails from listeners with all of THEIR stories: planning for the future, freezing embryos, miscarriages, inseminations, commiseration, edification...all of this has come from talking about her private conundrum, publicly. Spermcast was featured on the Huffington Post and Washington Post. Molly is currently fielding interest to adapt her podcast into a book and a TV show, while she continues to take steps to make her dream of motherhood come true. 
 
 Additionally, after honing her editing and producing skills with her own podcast, Molly was able to start working as a podcast editor for several other Earios shows. 
 
 This is the kind of thing a podcast can achieveâ€”by finally giving more women an opportunity to use their voices they can tell urgent and necessary stories that otherwise would not see the light of day. While Earios is guaranteed to create jobs for creators and content that would otherwise not be made, this is the ultimate goal: to make something that transcends the medium and makes a real change, sparks a real conversation, creates more jobs.",N/A,amanda@earios.net,Amanda Lund,562-773-1786,[],[],"['Jobs per capita', 'Minority- and women-owned firms', 'Arts establishments per capita']",['LA is the best place to CONNECT'],For-profit organization,['No'],N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,NA,@eariosnetwork,@eariosnetwork,http://earios.net,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1936438128/earios-a-woman-run-podcast-network,['Friend/colleague'],0-5 employees,Yes,5-Feb,[],[],[],[],Pasadena,525 Lakeview Rd,83-1413066,Â EariosÂ,California,91105,[],[],N/A,,,Earios,LA is the best place to CREATE,"$0-$50,000",,,"Under the guidance of our three foundersâ€”Amanda, Maria and Priyankaâ€”we have recruited and will continue to recruit high-profile and emerging female creators like Margaret Cho and Aasha Davis to develop podcasts on our network. We work with them to develop their idea (with the proper resources) provide them with support staff and marketing teams to help with the production and airing of their podcasts. Our founders have extensive experience with the podcasting industry, they have the expertise and drive to nurture the diverse voices of female creators. 
 
 
 
  Despite the fact that podcasting is growing at an adoption rate faster than cable television and 42 million Americans listen to podcasts weekly (5x more than go to the movies!) only 22% of podcasts are hosted by women and an additional 11% are co-hosted by women. 44% of podcast listeners are women. The diverse hosts we have already started developing podcasts with bring huge audiences in traditional and social media: the top 10 Earios hosts will have an outreach of over 100 million followers across social media. Earios hopes to become the most influential place for women's voices. 
 
  Podcasts educate, entertain, investigate, and spark essential conversation, but when womenâ€™s voices are excluded, only a small portion of experiences are represented. Through Earios, we will not only reach the huge amount of Americans that already listen to podcasts, but we will engage with audiences that have previously been ignored. This network isnâ€™t just about hiring and amplifying womenâ€™s voices, itâ€™s also about providing a necessary perspective to a public conversation already taking place on an enormous scale.
 
  
 
  We have already recording six shows that we plan to launch with in Spring of 2019. Over the next few months, we will need to take these six shows into full production with the intention to backlog at least five episodes by end of April. 
 
  Now, what lays in front of us are challenges we cannot overcome without adequate funding: we plan on either acquiring or renting studio space to record and edit the podcasts. We need to hire support staff: Producers, researchers (if necessary), social media, legal and accounting, and marketing experts.
 
 
 
  Earios aims to give women a chance to develop, produce and record their own podcasts in an industry that has largely excluded them. The organization will give women of all colors the opportunity to build careers in all areas of the podcasting industryâ€”from hosting to producing to managing the network, the goal is to offer women a chance to helm their own creations.
 
  The potential and possibilities that Earios would offer creators are endless: Podcasts have gone on to be adopted into award-winning television shows and films, inspired books, and have long acted as launching pads for careers of comedians, journalists and pundits. By lending this kind of platform to women exclusively, Earios will offer a necessary equitable opportunity to create.",,,Active,CREATE,,,Voting Period,

She had started her new company after her previous apparel company had failed due to the dissolution of the textile industry to foreign outsourcing, and was finally achieving the success with domestic sales with her fruit bar products she'd always wanted. Her major problem though was that she was getting requests from foreign purchasers and did not know how to strategically or safely fulfill them. She knew that if she could stably expand, she would be able to hire and train more staff and further increase sales and opportunities. But NAFTA uncertainties, issues with China, along with the standard learning curve of issues ranging from marketing and market intelligence to banking and taxes were all holding her back.
 
 
 
 She joined our community and was able to access graduates of universities with international business focuses, banks specializing in trade finance, accounting firms to advise on tax changes, consultants focused on international trade, the many government resources that most companies are unaware of, as well as a range of social media influencers in key markets who in the near future will likely be helping her to develop authentic local appeal in their markets. On top of this, there are two major family conglomerates â€” one from Southeast Asia and another from the Middle East â€” who are interested in investing in her company to be able to strategically expand into their respective markets by utilizing their relationships and influence. In terms of confidence-building, our community and resources have given her an open pathway for expanding her company's opportunities in ways that would have taken her a very long time to create on her own. 
 
 
 
 It is too early to assess the total impact, but every participant in this relationship sees greater opportunity. The foreign investors are curious about what else they can access in the LA area, the universities are eager to provide more students and training, and the influencers see LA as a beacon of multidimensional activity for them.

 Execution of this program includes further developing two audiences: foreign audiences (to invest, collaborate, partner, contribute knowledge, make purchases) and domestic audiences with interesting products or services but who need key relationships, market intelligence and access, capital, and sales to drive growth and hiring. To attract more of both audiences â€” foreign and domestic â€”Â we will need to purchase marketing services and access to contact databases, as well as use the financial buffer that this grant will provide to be able to devote more time to developing both of these audiences rather than focus primarily on raising sponsorship. Since GetGlobal's first edition in 2016, we have developed a network of over 80 partner organizations. Leveraging them properly is mostly an issue of time and effort. 
 
 
 
 POPULATION SERVED
 
 The population being served is primarily the domestic audience, and for this program our focus would be LA area companies that are capable of engaging in meaningful international activity â€” acting strategically and in sustained fashion in its marketing, sales, and general operation. Typically these are companies above $5 million in annual revenue, but there are exceptions below that threshold. The target persons within those companies are usually founders, chief executives, heads of marketing and sales, supply chain and logistics, CFOs, and anyone else with the word ""international"" in their title.

We regularly experience staff turnover throughout the year. This could result in schools having staff that was not trained in W.A.R. curriculum. ASAS-LA has assembled a W.A.R. committee comprised of key leadership staffâ€“all of which have been trained in this curriculum. They created and implemented the following plan of action:
 
 â€¢ Created a short-term plan for transitional staff to be identified and trained
 
 â€¢ Selected portions of the curriculum that are pertinent to the impact of the program to focus on leading up to CampUs
 
 â€¢ Matched our program support team to sites based on level of training and experiences
 
 â€¢ Conducted observations and provide support as needed.","ASAS-LA regularly adapts WAR based on changes in the educational field overall. Our staff stays informed about trends and changes when it comes to colleges, high schools or careers. What sets us apart from other programs is that we collaborate with our neighboring high schools in certain sections such as the high school portion to participate in the high schoolsâ€™ panel to give the students a real experience and an opportunity to hear what they went through. Often times, past participants come back to apply to be junior counselors or camp counselors for current students.","It is the goal of After-School All-Stars, Los Angeles for all of our students to grow up safe and healthy, graduate high school and go on to college, find careers they love and give back to their communities. We measure our progress toward these goals by examining the following outputs and outcomes:
 
 
 
 Output 1: Students will regularly attend school
 
 Outcome 1: 85% of W.A.R. participants will attend school for at least 90% of days
 
 
 
 Output 2: Students will be academically engaged with high self-efficacy
 
 Outcome 2: 75% of W.A.R. participants will agree that they can do well in school even if it's challenging
 
 
 
 Output 3: Students will move toward on-time high school graduation
 
 Outcome 3: 100% of participants will achieve on-time grade promotion
 
 
 
 Output 4: Students will develop career aspirations
 
 Outcome 4: 75% of CEO participants will demonstrate confidence in their ability to understand and navigate career pathways
 
 
 
 We measure success against the outcomes above using three primary data sources: pre and post student surveys; school and district data sharing; and participation tracking through Cityspan.
 
 
 
 Pre and Post Student Surveys: Surveys are administered in the first and last two weeks of the program year by the Programs team and sent to the National Research and Evaluation team. The National Research and Evaluation team compiles, cleans, and analyzes the data. They then provide actionable, data informed feedback to chapters and sites, which chapters then use to inform and improve programs going forward. Each summer, pre and post survey data is analyzed to examine both group and individual-level changes, as well as provide an end-of-year snapshot of student strengths and areas of growth.
 
 
 
 School and District Data Sharing: ASAS-LA engages in data-sharing with school and district partners in order to obtain information on attendance, and on-time grade promotion of participants, suspensions/behavioral referrals, and other relevant data. Data is cleaned, compiled, and analyzed by the National Research and Evaluation team, with analyses examining both within year and year over year changes.
 
 
 
 Cityspan: In seeking to ensure that we continually improve our programming, ASAS-LA developed a feedback loop system tied to our attendance tracking system. We utilize Cityspan, a nationally-recognized customizable database system, to collect data on dosage levels per program, demographic information on students in our programs, and attendance rates.","Personnel

Being 10 years old and in a new school was scary. She would walk through the gray hallways everyday alone. This girl could be any new 6th grader in a middle school in Los Angeles. But she wasnâ€™t just any girl. Ivonne Gonzalez attended Griffith Steam Magnet School as a student. Her 2 parents worked long hours. Ivonne would walk the streets of East LA by herself to get home after-school. There were no adults home when she opened her front door. She would make herself a snack, do her homework and get ready for bed before her parents returned home. Ivonne would complete her homework but much of the work would be incorrect. She became frustrated and even more isolated because she felt like she was disappointing her parents. During parent conferences, her teachers suggested that she join the after-school program provided at the school. This was her turning point. Ivonne discovered she had a true passion, music. Her mentor, Jose, would work with her academically and musically every afternoon. Ivonne participated in the We Are Ready program after-school. She began to research the different pathways that would give her a great education as well as continue to allow her to pursue her passion of music. She never really had anyone talk to her about high school or college. The W.A.R. program empowered her and because of it she was able to decide what high school she wanted to go to that would align with her future career. Ivonne sites her attendance at CampUs (ASAS-LAâ€™s high school/college readiness summer camp) as the inspiration to become a student mentor in our W.A.R. program after she graduated.

WR helps to reverse this trend by solidifying studentsâ€™ connections between school and the possibilities for their futures, leading them to understand the importance of their education. We then give them the tools to be successful in the classroom so that they can achieve their goals. We engage students through the following components: 
 
 --CAREER EXPOSURE (September-December): ASAS-LA begins with lessons on self-awareness and self-identity, helping students explore their personality characteristics, leadership style, passions, and what defines them. Students use this information to explore a minimum of 6 careers per student. During this process, they research: what people in the profession do; qualities, and skills needed; education required; what programs/institutions could help them prepare for this career; average salary; working conditions; benefits offered; future outlook for this career; and what steps they must personally take to prepare for this career. 
 
 --HIGH SCHOOL READINESS (January-April): Students plan for their future beginning with high school. They design their 4-year plans based on the discoveries they made in their career choices. We help them ensure that their high school offers classes that are directly linked to the careers they researched. Students also learn about studying and note taking skills. Based on the careers and their research, students further research what steps they will need to take after high school to prepare themselves. Students learn the basics of creating a resume and participate in mock interviews. 
 
 --CampUs(June): WAR culminates with a week-long summer program, CampUs, which takes place on a college campus and gives students an extra push as they enter high school. CampUs helps students examine connections between academic and career success while exploring college and career paths. Students live in the dorms for a week, learn about how to apply to college, and take daily classes on how to be successful in school and in the workforce.

8833460323,National Health Foundation,National Health Foundationâ€™s (NHF) mission is to improve the health of individuals and under-resourced communities by taking action on the social determinants of health.,"As with most community change initiatives or community organizing projects, slow, incremental changes are an anticipated challenge. This challenge is even more pronounced when it comes to youth organizers. Slow Incremental changes lowers group moral and causes drop-out among youth organizers. It is difficult to research a community issue and develop a passion for addressing it only to be told it will take months or even years before action can be taken. NHF will overcome this challenge in multiple ways. One, a key component of Health Academy is training youth organizers on policy concepts. Youth are informed from the beginning they are taking on a task that can take time - even years. NHFâ€™s Adult Allies are skilled at organizing youth around a cause, even if that cause is still being fought after they graduate high school. Second, Health Academy ensures students get civically involved so they see the process of change first hand. Students are encouraged and supported in attending or even joining neighborhood councils and attending City Council meetings to speak to council members. Third, NHFâ€™s Adult Allies train youth using fun and engaging activities. Youth are given research tasks that involve being creative and fun. For example, Health Academy students at Santee Education Complex wrote, filmed and presented short videos on their food share project aimed at reducing food waste.","There are few other organizations doing youth organizing work and achieving similar levels of success. Many organizations across Los Angeles understand the importance of involving young people in social, political and environmental change movements, but few allow youth to direct the movement. NHFâ€™s Health Academy program equals the playing field by empowering youth to be full decision makers for identifying and implementing strategies that can bring health equity to fruition. While the community organizations that conduct youth organizing programs typically have their agenda or community issues set before getting youth involved, NHF encourages youth to identify their own action items and supports the youth in addressing their identified issues. For example, NHF did not address healthy food access issues in South LA until Health Academy students identified corner store conversations as a viable option to decrease health disparities in their community.","NHF tracks youth organizing outcomes and impacts on two different levels: impacts on the community and impacts on the youth organizers themselves. NHFâ€™s youth organizers focus on creating policy, system, and environmental (PSE) changes that create communities that are more supportive of healthier lifestyles. Evaluation of PSE changes vary in scope and range from assessing change in knowledge, behavior, and/or organizational practices. As for assessing progress and impact on youth organizers, NHF tracks academic performance through graduation rates and college admittance. NHF regularly collects testimonials on how organizing work has impacted youthsâ€™ view on community involvement, their plans for future civic engagement, and career and college goals.","I.

The theme was â€œGood Health for All: Addressing Equity Where We Live, Learn, Work and Playâ€ and it boasted nation-wide attendance. Among the lineup of speakers who were there to share emerging research, best practices, community-based efforts and policy strategies was Jessica Gallegos, an alumna of NHFâ€™s Health Academy program. She was invited to speak in a plenary entitled, â€œLeading the Way: Youth Advocating and Driving Policy, Systems and Environmental Change.â€
 
 
 
 It had been almost a year since Jessica graduated from Thomas Jefferson Senior High and started her freshman year as a biochemistry major at UCLA. But for her presentation she recalled all the good work done through her Health Academy experience. During her time in Health Academy, Jessica and her peers played an integral role in getting a hydration station installed at her school and establishing a wayfinding signage system at a major corridor in her neighborhood to promote walking. She often took the lead on presenting youth-led efforts to key stakeholders in her school and community. 
 
 
 
 A nineteen-year-old Latina from South Central Los Angeles was sharing her story, and hundreds of public health professionals were listening. Jessica noticed this as she stood at the podium, â€œI felt tense going on stage and seeing my name card being placed on the panelistsâ€™ table because I didnâ€™t think I was a person others would care to listen to and let alone take notes fromâ€¦ but they did. Once I started speaking I saw many people nodding their heads in agreement and even taking pictures of my presentation â€“ of MY experience.â€
 
 
 
 NHF has youth just like Jessica, who, even a year after Health Academy, are still passionate about giving back to her community. Jessica said, â€œIâ€™ve thought about the public health field for a while and coming to this conference is making me consider it even more. I realized that the doctor I once wished to be is the last visit a person would want to â€“ or should â€“ make. The real difference happens way before that. Itâ€™s in where we live and whatâ€™s around us. Itâ€™s a reality my community knows too well.â€","West Adams Preparatory High School will be NHFâ€™s primary collaborator for this proposal. West Adams has a zone of attendance that includes the Pico-Union, Harvard Heights, Jefferson Park, Adams-Normandie, and University Park neighborhoods. This zone is represented by several different municipalities (specifically, three neighborhood councils and four city council districts), which represents an opportunity for youth to organize stakeholders and other partners in a wide political landscape. West Adams will provide on-site staff support to help in the engagement and develop of youth. This will include collaborating in strategies to recruit youth into the Health Academy program, as well as support in other logistics of the program, such as providing a meeting space for youth workshops, assisting NHF staff to ensure that all program activities are compliant with LAUSD policies, and more.
 
 
 
 NHF will also collaborate with Woodbury Universityâ€™s Agency for Civic Engagement, or ACE, whose faculty and students will provide services to develop a mobile application that will serve as an interactive map/database of community resources that youth identify through their research. This database can include parks, libraries, government offices, health clinics, food retailers that accept CalFresh, and many others.

 For LA2050, National Health Foundation is proposing to expand Health Academy to West Adams Preparatory High School (West Adams), thereby activating a cohort of young people to advocate for healthier communities, and developing the next generation of public health and civic leaders. Building on Health Academyâ€™s six years of success in two South Los Angeles high schools (Thomas Jefferson Senior High and Santee Education Complex), NHF is prepared to reach additional communities and empower a new cohort of community youth leaders. 
 
 
 
 NHFâ€™s youth organizing approach is rooted in youth participatory action research (YPAR), a collaborative effort that equitably involves youth residents from a target community as stakeholders and decision-makers in all aspects of system change campaigns to improve community health. In YPAR, participants are regarded as the experts of their community who not only live through the barriers to good health and well-being in their day-to-day lives, but are also the best informants on identifying possible solutions to these challenges. In this process, youth lead the entire project: from formative research, development, implementation, all the way to evaluation. Often, the solutions that come to fruition during this process are ones that address health issues closer to the root cause, and involve policy and systems change that produce lasting and sustainable impacts. 
 
 
 
 In partnership with West Adams, NHF will integrate â€˜Adult Alliesâ€™ (trained staff members) into the school to facilitate the Health Academy program. Adult Allies will recruit and train youth in key public health concepts, community research and organizing, and assist youth throughout the YPAR process through curriculum-based weekly training meetings. By the end of one school year, Adult Allies will have trained and supported youth organizers to identify and develop at least one system change campaign to address health inequities and the social determinants of health in Pico-Union, Los Angeles. These projects often focus on access to healthy foods or improving the built environment.

Planned Parenthood health centers in the state of California serve over a third of all Planned Parenthood patients nationwide, and in order to meet local need, our health centers must function as high-volume, high-capacity sites. Our Pasadena health center, for instance, sees upwards of 85 patients a day, and over 90% of these patients are seeking out preventive care. Since the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act and the Medi-Cal expansion, we've made a concerted effort to prioritize convenience and to ensure our preventive care patients are in and out of their appointment in under an hour. Properly screening patients for depression and anxiety will slow down our appointment cycle time and could adversely affect wait times overall. One solution to overcome this issue is telehealth, which we'll be piloting in tandem with behavioral health services. By virtually linking patients to other Planned Parenthood clinicians, social workers, and navigators, patients that require more time-consuming interventions can be removed from the health center workflow and connected to off-site providers, who can then dedicate the proper time to caring for these patients.","The lack of publicly funded behavioral health care providers in LA County is well-documented, and across the state of California, over 60% of mental health issues go untreated. Women are twice as likely to suffer from depression as men, and out of perinatal and postpartum women, one in five are affected by mental health disorders. Unfortunately, one third of all California women also experience a form of intimate partner violence. LGBTQ+ people are three times more likely to experience mental health conditions, and four times more likely to attempt suicide. Since Planned Parenthood health centers serve a high percentage of women and LGBTQ+ patients, we have both the opportunity and the responsibility to better care for these populations by launching behavioral health services, and through the support of LA2050, we'll become the first Planned Parenthood affiliate in Southern California to do so. Our patients are also requesting for us to expand into this new service. During a recent series of patient focus groups, participants remarked that our health centers already feel like a ""home base"" where intimate questions are asked with compassion and without judgment. In this safe environment, ""it makes sense to talk about mental health."" Another individual remarked that Planned Parenthood ""cares for you"" and that ""mental health is so connected to everything Planned Parenthood already does.""","At our Planned Parenthood affiliate, every department tracks and reviews dashboard indicators in each area of our strategic plan. This evaluation is done quarterly and then assessed by the Board of Directors, which convenes at least ten times per year. On a monthly basis, our Leadership Team also reviews 51 metrics pertaining to: Health Center Access; Revenue; Service and Quality; Compliance; Outreach and Marketing; and Finance. Each month, we track whether or not we are on-target or within 5% of our goal, and if we are not, we respond intelligently. Health center managers and their staff undergo a similar monthly performance evaluation process on 40 metrics pertaining to: appointment access, quality indicators, patient satisfaction, and financial performance. Although our affiliate is only a mid-size network of health centers, one of our profound strengths is thatâ€”because our leadership and health center staff convene so frequently to communally analyze the organizationâ€™s most current resultsâ€”we can quickly address the problems, act on the needs, and adapt to the trends revealed by our data. As part of this pilot, we'll incorporate behavioral health metrics into both the evaluations performed by our Leadership Team and our health center staff. 
 
 
 
 Additionally, we're currently collaborating with the USC Masters in Social Work program to develop an evaluative tool to define and track outcomes related to our expanded patient navigation work. This evaluative tool will be incorporated before the end of 2019 and will enable us to better assess our ability to successfully hand-off patients to both external health care and social service providers. 
 
 
 
 We also use patient surveys and reviews to qualitatively evaluate our services and our health centers, and we frequently engage patients in focus groups and maintain an active patient advisory council.","Year One Budget for Behavioral Health Pilot and Expanded Patient Navigation

The fundraising goal of this campaign is $6.8 million, and in under two years, we've already raised 75% of our goal. The long-term sustainability of this work will be assured by this expansion campaign and by our efforts to maximize public reimbursements for this care. Additional costs will be immediately covered by over $3.5 million in annual support from individual and institutional donors. Finally, we have an additional $100,000 in pending grant requests to directly support this pilot.","['Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter']","We're seeking support to revolutionize sexual health care by piloting behavioral health across our growing network of Planned Parenthood health centers and by expanding our patient navigation program, which links patients to a range of medical and social services. Planned Parenthood is a safe space and an essential safety net. We pride ourselves on delivering compassionate, judgment-free care, and this expansion into mental health will be our next step to care for our patients more holistically.","['East LA', 'San Gabriel Valley']",Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"We were founded in 1933 by a pioneering woman doctor and fourteen visionary women, who were united in their belief that everyone in LA should have access to contraception, regardless of income or insurance. We're one of the oldest Planned Parenthood affiliates in the nation, which is testament to LA's longstanding dedication to women's rights and public health. When our first health center opened 85 years ago, dozens of publicly funded clinics across the city had shuttered due to the Great Depression. Indigent women and families all over LA County had been cut off from sexual and reproductive care, and our founders worked tirelessly to correct this inequity. This was our guiding ethos then, as it is now: Everyone should have access to health care--no matter what. During our early history, we provided diaphragms and sex ed from a small Pasadena bungalow. Today, we're the most trusted and sought-after provider of sexual and reproductive care for 24 communities in Northeast LA and the San Gabriel Valley, serving 65,000 patient visits each year and delivering over 15,000 opportunities for sex education. 
 
 
 
 Although we remain committed as ever to our founding mission, over the past eight decades, we've evolved our medical services to deliver more comprehensive, compassionate, and first-rate health care. For instance, in 1961, less than a year after oral contraceptives received FDA-approval, women across the San Gabriel Valley could access the pill with revolutionary ease, not only at our health centers but also through community partnerships we forged with libraries, grocery stores, and even churches.
 
 
 
 We continue to innovate new ways to deliver health care and respond to patient and public health needs. In doing so, we're breaking down structural barriers to accessing care by making it more timely, relevant, and equitable for all people. In recent history, we've made strides to deliver more inclusive care for our LGBTQ+ patients. Last year, we became the only public provider of PEP/PrEP HIV-prevention medicine in our service area, and this year, we launched trans care, including hormone therapy. For this work, we were recently awarded the Health Care Innovation Award from the national Planned Parenthood federation.","This is not technically a collaborative project, although a central goal for the coming year will be to deepen our partnerships with local mental health care providers, substance abuse centers, and other social service agencies in order to better coordinate care beyond our doors and to guarantee patients receive the resources they need. We maintain an extensive community resource list of providers with whom we have a referral relationship. This list includes community primary care clinics, dental care, emergency services, mental health services, domestic violence and sexual assault resources, STI and HIV/AIDS resources, LGBTQ+ resources, pre-natal and pregnancy resources, adoption and post-abortion resources, infertility and vasectomy services, food and housing insecurity resources, substance abuse centers, and resources for teens. 
 
 
 
 Throughout the proposed pilot, we'll seek out guidance from the LA County Department of Mental Health, Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, the California Telehealth Network, the Planned Parenthood Connect to Care telehealth project, and Planned Parenthood Northern California, which is already offering behavioral health services.",heyrachelabelson@gmail.com,Rachel Abelson,626-794-5737,[],[],[],[],Non-profit organization,"['Yes, in 2016']",see above,see above,see above,see above for our website,https://www.facebook.com/PPPSGV/,@pppsgv,@pppsgv,https://www.pppsgv.org,http://www.weareplannedparenthood.org/onlineactions/nJT69mwMk0SfsDltv9tFnA2,['LA2050 website'],51+ employees,No,,[],[],"['Healthcare access', 'Rates of mental illness', 'Residents receiving coordinated healthcare services']",['LA is the healthiest place to CONNECT'],Altadena,"2333 Lake Avenue, Second Floor",95-1916050,Planned Parenthood Pasadena and San Gabriel Valley,California,91001,[],[],,https://www.weareplannedparenthood.org/onlineactions/-1TJt9FXXE--vl0dHnHSFQ2?sourceid=1000065&affiliateID=090090&_ga=2.204750736.1413886104.1552425639-2024363711.1549414005&_gac=1.214389989.1551472347.Cj0KCQiAzePjBRCRARIsAGkrSm6Q0-ejXJY6kBcKKc_0y73P89ytn0AEEp6DIo19hbGDu3Yvhp5-5CUaAh4vEALw_wcB,http://www.weareplannedparenthood.org/onlineactions/nJT69mwMk0SfsDltv9tFnA2,Behavioral Health Care at Planned Parenthood,LA is the best place to LIVE,$1 million +,,,,"Our project will make LA the best place to LIVE by ensuring 35,000 local people can access behavioral health care. Our decision to pilot behavioral health was inspired by feedback from patient focus groups and input from community partners. In 2017, nearly a third of LA residents reported missing over a week of work due to mental health issues, and the Kaiser Foundation has shown that only a third of California's need for mental health is being met by the current provider landscape. Since our health centers are often the only source of care for the majority of our patients, we believe Planned Parenthood is uniquely positioned to become both a safe space and a safety net for not only sexual and reproductive care but also for mental and emotional well-being. 
 
 
 
 Program Strategies and Timeline: During the grant period, we'll pilot a two-phased approach to launch behavioral health. Throughout 2019, we'll screen all adult patients for depression and anxiety, provide direct interventions, and offer warm hand-offs to our referral partners. This pilot will provide the data to develop a long-term service delivery plan that responds to local gaps in care. We'll also test innovative interventions, such as offering patients drop-in support groups for symptoms-based issues like grief or shame and linking patients to licensed clinical social workers via telehealth. During this period, we'll expand our referral network and continue to develop our patient navigation program, so that we can successfully connect patients into counseling as well as to a range of support services that can directly address other social determinants of health, including housing/food insecurity and substance abuse. At the grant end, we'll enter the second phase, offering in-network, ongoing counseling sessions for all patients. 
 
 
 
 Population Served: The target population is the 35,000 unduplicated patients we serve each year from our four sites in Pasadena, Eagle Rock, Alhambra, and Glendora. We're opening three new health centers in the next three years, first in Baldwin Park, then in Glendale and Highland Park, and LA2050 support will provide for these future patients as well. Our typical patient is a young woman seeking birth control. Despite this trend, over 13% of our patients are men, and 12% are over the age of 35. Our service area houses one-fifth of LA Countyâ€™s population and is one of the most ethnically and racially diverse areas in the country. Over 50% of our patients identify as Hispanic/Latinx. In terms of race, 52% of our patients are White (including Hispanic); 25% Multiracial; 16% Asian/Pacific Islander; 6% Black; and 1% Other. Cities in our service area feature some of the highest income inequality in the state, and this disparity creates barriers to care. In the last year, 92% of our patients lived at 200% or below the Federal Poverty Level and 66% lived at 100% or below. For a family of four, living at 100% the poverty level translates to less than $25,750 a year.",,Active,LIVE,,,Voting Period,

Many spaces, even in warehouse, art and mixed commercial/live districts have limitations on parking, curfews on entry, loading and unloading, noise, power capability, filming, photography, video and recording of digital art. 
 
 
 
 In the traditional analog world, people worked in silos and information moved slowly if ever, between mediums and departments. In this new world people work need to work together, and information is exchanged and content is created instantaneously. It's been a difficult transition for people, businesses and industry. For young independent artists, there has never been a model. Technology today, gives artists the tools to create infinite possibilities. Access to knowledge, resources and space to create is what's limited. 
 
 
 
 Our Los Angeles journey began in New York renting studios spaces in order to create art in Midtown, Gramercy, the Flatiron and Brooklyn. An average rate of $35 / per hour for 80 hours a month just barely covers studio rent, but a rate low enough that most struggling artists are able to pay for a space, resources and knowledge. 
 
 
 
 In Los Angeles, mixed live / commercial space is lower cost, and the demand for creative space is higher. The infinity Incubator is a space agnostic concept that suits raw, underutilized spaces. Initially we thought that a live / work scenario was most suitable, but have now determined that may not be the case. Currently we are in the process of exploring other commercial real estate options more suitable to creating and incubating 21st century art, community and commerce.","1.

9173236266,Santa Monica College,Santa Monica College is an educational leader and innovator in west Los Angeles that fosters personal and intellectual exploration while students learn to contribute to the local and global community.,"One of the challenges of developing a highly innovative, collaborative project in a community like Santa Monica is that there is a perception that the Santa Monica community and its citizenry have significantly more resources than other parts of the greater Los Angeles area. 
 
 
 
 With three Title I schools in the city, and a socio-economically diverse population of residents as well as employees who have jobs in Santa Monica, there is substantial need for tuition assistance to enable the Lab School to be accessible to a wide range of families. 
 
 
 
 Using the resources of the City of Santa Monica, the resource agency, Connections for Children, which serves Los Angeles and Santa Monica families in need of child care with referrals and subsidies, and a concerted outreach and fundraising strategy, the Early Childhood Lab School anticipates combining multiple resources to provide financial assistance.","There are no other public/private partnerships in west Los Angeles addressing the need for quality early care and learning experiences for young children by coupling it with the training and education of early care providers. While West Los Angeles College provides an on-site lab school for students enrolled in the ECE Program, it is not working with its local municipality to provide a coordinated city-wide approach that has the support of public entities and private industry.","This project will work to improve student success at both the early childhood level as well as the community college level. Specifically, this project will increase the number of young children and families with access to high quality early care and learning services. The Lab School will support Santa Monicaâ€™s Learn + Thrive strategic goal to ensure that all Santa Monica children are ready for kindergarten. It will achieve this goal by providing direct care to children, but also by training early care professionals who will find employment in the field and positively impact children and families not directly served by the Lab School. To assess the impact of this project on this outcome, SMC will work with its partners to collect the following data:
 
 
 
 1) Number of children served directly by the Lab School, including socio-economic demographics of these children;
 
 2) Readiness for kindergarten as these children transition;
 
 3) Number of community college students who complete the program and enter the workforce;
 
 4) Number of young children cared for by program graduates by geographic location and socio-economic data; and
 
 5) Impact of program graduates on the care of young children in their places of employment, which may be assessed through parent/employer satisfaction surveys, child success data, and readiness for kindergarten.
 
 
 
 This project will also strengthen community college student success, focusing on completion. Santa Monica College offers one of the most successful early childhood education programs in the state, and this partnership with the City of Santa Monica to offer a Lab School in the community will only improve the programâ€™s reputation. While the program enjoys a relatively high student success rate with more than 80% of students on average successfully completing their coursework each semester, there is a significant equity gap among student groups. The Lab School will help address these equity gaps by providing students with mentoring, support, observation, and hands-on training with early care professionals who are among the best in their field. The inclusion of culturally responsive, equity minded curriculum that connects theory with practice will help ensure that both community college students and low-income children and families, particularly those traditionally underrepresented in quality educational experiences at both the pre-school and postsecondary education level, obtain the skills and resources they need to be successful. To assess the impact of this project on this outcome, SMC will work with its partners to collect the following data:
 
 
 
 1) Number of community college students enrolled in the program each semester by socio-economic demographics;
 
 2) Number of community college students who participate in on-site activities in the Lab School by activity and demographic groups;
 
 3) Student success data for community college students by demographic groups, including course retention, successful course completion, program persistence, and program completion; and
 
 4) Number of students who complete a Certificate of Achievement and/or an Associateâ€™s degree, earn or renew a child development permit, and/or transfer to a baccalaureate program within 6 years by student demographic groups;
 
 5) Student satisfaction with the Lab School experience.
 
 
 
 In the first year of the Lab School, the Lab School advisory committee will review this data on a semester basis to facilitate timely review and revision as the data indicates. However, as the Lab School enters the 2021-2022 academic year, program assessment will occur on an annual basis.","Santa Monica College will use grant funding to support start-up costs related to licensing, hiring and training of staff, curriculum development, and program marketing. SMC will contract with Growing Place to hire the Program Director, while all other costs will be supported directly by the college. As the Lab School opens and enrolls young children (beginning August 2020), the Program Director will become a self-sustaining position under the supervision of Growing Place supported by participant tuition.

One such student is Dina, former SMC ECE major who transferred to California State University, Northridge, and completed her Bachelor of Arts degree in Education. Although she attended classes for early childhood education and indicated a goal to work directly in the field, she found a second passion in early childhood advocacy and is now working as the Chief of Staff for Councilwoman Jeannine Pearce in the City of Long Beach, District 2. Later this year, she will be announcing her candidacy for the school board. Dina attributes her interest in political activism and early childhood policy to SMCâ€™s ECE faculty, who involved her in numerous local and state level ECE policy campaigns in her time here at SMC. She was a shy and soft-spoken student and she said that she was able to find her voice as a result of her amazing ECE professors support. 
 
 
 
 On the child care side, there is great anticipation of having high quality, full-time infant, toddler and preschool care and education. For example, the many workers who have jobs in Santa Monicaâ€™s hotels and other hospitality related businesses, look forward to having a trusted program for their children near their jobs. The local union representing hotel workers has expressed how helpful the Early Childhood Lab School will be when it opens in fall 2020 and beyond. Furthermore, there is interest among the Lab School advisory committee for the Lab School to serve not only as a model for other communities but to share its knowledge and expertise throughout the region, and in fact Growing Place has already begun inviting other educators and policymakers into its facility for networking and sharing.","This project has five primary partners including:
 
 
 
 â€¢ Santa Monica College is the lead organization on this project and will 1) oversee the Santa Monica Early Childhood Lab School; 2) manage the contract with Growing Place; 3) provide early childhood education coursework and programming that lead to certificates and degrees in Early Childhood Education; 4) facilitate the placement of students in the Lab School; and 5) lead ongoing fundraising initiatives to ensure that low-income families have access to quality care.
 
 â€¢ City of Santa Monica has contributed the land upon which Santa Monica College is building the Lab School, as well as significant financial support to outfit the Lab School with the high quality teaching and learning tools both in the indoor and outdoor spaces. The City will also continue to provide tuition assistance to help ensure that low-income families in Santa Monica have access to high quality child care.
 
 â€¢ The RAND Corporation has long-standing interest in helping improve the well-being of children and families through research, analysis, and advocacy. The Lab School is located near the RAND Campus and will serve RAND employees. As its commitment to the City of Santa Monica for supporting the community, the RAND Corporation has set aside $500,000 to ensure that low- to middle-income families can afford this quality of care. The RAND Corporation will also help Santa Monica College and its partners to assess the impact of the Lab School on young children and their families served by the school, community college students enrolled in SMCâ€™s ECE programs, and the communities that will be served by program graduates. 
 
 â€¢ Santa Monica College Foundation is a separate, non-profit, tax-exempt organization (501(c)3) through which private, tax- deductible donations are made for the benefit of Santa Monica College. SMC Foundation is leading efforts to raise resources to support the Santa Monica Early Childhood Lab School, focusing on both start-up costs, as well as ongoing tuition assistance needs to ensure that low-income families have access to quality care. 
 
 â€¢ The SMC Foundation provides student scholarships, faculty grants, and program support year round. In addition to financial support, the Foundation serves as a valuable resource to the dozens of academic and student programs across all campuses. We are committed to growing the number of grant and scholarship recipients each and every year.
 
 â€¢ Growing Place has been selected by Santa Monica College to oversee the child care program at the Lab School. Growing Place is one of the premier child care providers on the Westside with two facilities currently serving children and families who live and/or work in west Los Angeles. In addition, this project aligns with Growing Placeâ€™s goal to help train other early educators.",McQuay-Peninger_Laurel@smc.edu,Laurie McQuay-Peninger,310-434-3718,[],[],[],[],Government,['No'],"City of Santa Monica Government (cityofsantamonica)

First, the Lab School offers an opportunity for the City of Santa Monica to develop an innovative public-private partnership that delivers outstanding early care and learning to the children and families of Santa Monica and other Westside neighborhoods. Second, the Lab School advances the vision of SMC to provide a training site for its nationally accredited Early Childhood Education Program that will allow students to practice what they learn in class and apply it in a real world setting under the guidance of highly qualified and well-trained early care and learning professionals. These students will then positively impact early care and learning services throughout Los Angeles as they complete their courses and return to their communities. 
 
 
 
 In 2012, the two organizations approved an agreement to build a college-managed center on land owned by the city in downtown Santa Monica, breaking ground in Spring 2018. SMC expects to open the facility in Fall 2020 and reach full operational status by January 2021, enrolling children from 12 weeks to age 5. SMC selected Growing Place, a nationally accredited non-profit child care provider to oversee the child care program. SMC and Growing Place staff and teachers will collaborate to align and strengthen their respective curricula and best practices, incorporating the principles and practices of Reggio Emilia to offer creative indoor and outdoor programming, including music, art, dramatic play, STEM, woodworking, and gardening to engage young children in education.
 
 
 
 This project will serve two distinct groups, including SMC students pursuing careers in early care and education and families in need of early care and education services. SMCâ€™s ECE program enrolls more than 900 students annually. More than 70% of students represent underserved ethnic and racial groups, while more than 50% qualify for state and federal financial aid. The Lab School will serve up to 110 children annually who reflect the diversity of Los Angeles County. The Lab School will set aside a minimum of 15 percent of its slots for low- to middle-income families, including SMC student families and families who work in Santa Monica but may not live there, providing tuition assistance as necessary. 
 
 
 
 This project will address two distinct LA2050 metrices. First, the project will increase access to high quality early care and learning services by providing full-day, full-year early care and education services, including high demand infant care. Second, the Lab School will increase college completion rates by providing students with a highly creative, innovative, and supportive learning environment where they can actively apply their skills and interests. At least 90% of students will complete their personal program goals within six years, including certificate/degree completion, child development permit attainment/renewal, and/or transfer.",,,,Active,LEARN,Under Review,,Moderation Process,

We will advocate for this to change.
 
 
 
 Urban Areas are known for a predominance of fast food restaurants. Can we have some of the restaurants give a discount of a healthier option one day a week or one month a year. In the Spring, McDonalds will have discounts on Fish Sandwiches on Fridays to appeal to customers with religious concerns. Could fast food restaurants have Salad Monday or No-Cheese Tuesday or Diet Soda Wednesday? Could we cut the calorie total of a fast food meal by 20 percent just one day a week? We will advocate for this to change.
 
 
 
 We have started to build better relationships with the local Neighborhood Council and the Los Angeles City Council District Eight Office. These will be allies in advocating and possibly legislating changes.
 
 
 
 ***Healthy Cooking Classes and Cooking Kitchen
 
 Basic ingredients such as lean meats and fresh vegetables can be prepared in a healthy manner. And they can be prepared with added fat, added salt, and in excess portions. Our Health Cooking Class have introduced our clients to methods to cook healthy foods with healthy methods.
 
 
 
 We have two cooking classes. Cook n' Connect is designed for Seniors to add a social component. Creative Chefs is aimed a general audience. 
 
 
 
 We currently have a total of twelve cooking classes each year. We would like to double the number of classes. One limitation is our programs are sharing a kitchen at Ascension Lutheran Church on West Boulevard in South Los Angeles. We have done cooking classes at other locations. We want to expand our use of other locations for our cooking classes.

As the City of Los Angeles works to design a Smart City, weâ€™ve been engaging within the community using art and systems thinking to understand pain points related to connectivity. For example, there are many residents who use the Cityâ€™s Public Library system for job searches, including resume creation. However users who are not familiar with how internet ads show up in search engine results run into the challenge of clicking on targeted â€˜adsâ€™ vs truly free online resume services. There are also scenarios where Senior residents may need to complete banking transactions that have become completely automated, and the customer does not have experience with using a kiosk or a computer. And most importantly, as the City transitions to providing increased digital services, everyone should be equipped with the ability to use tools such as the MyLA311 app and the ShakeAlertLA app, as well as strive towards becoming civicly engaged in the City through the use of its open data portal. These examples highlight the growing opportunity to digitally connect across the City of LA.

Urban youth have few opportunities to connect to nature, and therefore may lack interest in nature. A recent student in our high school program prepared an essay that describes what many in her community experience every day (excerpt:) â€œConcrete dominates my life. Every day I walk down concrete stairs, through concrete hallways, down concrete sidewalks, toward a mostly concrete school. It is everywhere and green is scarce. Seeing a â€œneighborhoodâ€ is difficult.â€
 
 
 
 LA Audubon offers the opportunity for thousands of students and members of the public to gain a better understanding of and connection to nature in our urban environment through hands-on activities. In particular, we aim to provide public school students from low-income communities with (1) a connection to the natural resources that are part of their city, and (2) an understanding that they have power to positively impact the environment by sharing what they learn with others.","Other organizations host nature programs. We aim for a more in-depth experience where people can engage in experiential learning while enjoying the great outdoors. We are uniquely positioned to provide thousands of urban youth access to open spaces because of our long-standing relationships with LA County schools and parks. We provide bus transportation to under-resourced schools who would otherwise be unable to participate in nature field trips. All of our programs operate entirely outdoors via agreements with State Parks and beaches. We scaffold programs to provide increasing opportunities for greater involvement in nature as students get older. For example, a single student could participate in all of our nature programs - beginning with a third-grade field trip to Ballona Wetlands, a middle school session at Kenneth Hahn Park, then as a high school intern at Baldwin Hills, and upon graduation become a community leader and paid LAAS intern.
 
 Our youth programs combine art with science and encourage creative thinking about plants, birds, insects and wildlife found in LA. We also engage the community in habitat restoration events at parks and beaches and aim to inspire widespread environmental stewardship. LA Audubon is a separate 501(c)(3) - donations to National

9713007172,CASA of Los Angeles,CASA of Los Angeles recruits and trains community volunteers (Court Appointed Special Advocates) to serve and advocate for children and youth in the dependency and foster care systems.,"There are currently over 30,000 children under the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles County Dependency Court, making it the largest system in the nation supporting children removed from the home due to allegations of abuse, neglect, and abandonment. Of those children, over 20,000 have been placed in the foster care system. In L.A. County, youth in foster care often have an average of six placements during their time in the dependency care system, and frequently as manyâ€”or moreâ€”county social workers assigned to their case over time. It is not surprising that these children experience the following distressing consequences: 85% of foster youth live with serious mental health challenges; 37% will not finish high school; 50% of girls in foster care became pregnant by age 17; and 27% of the homeless population have spent time in foster care. 
 
 
 
 Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs) help perform miracles for children who need them the mostâ€”children who lack safe and committed adults in their lives. CASAs help these children to become self-sufficient and responsible young adults. Our CASA volunteers come from all walks of lifeâ€”from retired teachers and social workers, to young professionals and stay-at-home moms. With so many children in care, CASA of Los Angeles has an overwhelming need to recruit many more CASA volunteers. However, in order to recruit more volunteers, CASA/LA must increase recruitment, training and support staff in order to grow recruitment and training efforts and to provide daily support to our volunteers in their work (many of whom have no personal or professional experience in the child welfare or judicial systems). Since achieving such scale is many years off at best, CASA has begun to strategize how to not only serve more youth, but to serve those youth who are most in need of a CASA volunteer: children in chronic out of home placement, children with severe medical and mental health needs, youth who are preparing to transition out of care, and youth who are involved in the juvenile justice system.","For 40 years, CASA of Los Angeles has been the only organization in Los Angeles providing court-appointed advocates to children and youth in the child welfare system who have experienced abuse and neglect. A CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) volunteer helps a child navigate not only the trials of the courtroom, but also the trials of a challenged childhood. CASA/LA is providing more services every year to more children in the dependency care system, and are recruiting more adult volunteers in order to support the physical, mental, psychological, and educational well-being of our communityâ€™s most vulnerable youth. Because CASAs are court-appointed, they are the only community members who can legally oversee a diversion case in lieu of a parent or guardian. For this reason, it is crucial that CASA recruits more volunteers to help these youth avoid the juvenile justice system.","In 2016, CASA/LA completed the full implementation and training for our new monitoring database Efforts to Outcomes (ETO) Social Solutions, which provides a way to track case progress, and is the beginning of outcomes measurement at CASA. When a case is assigned, both the Advocate Supervisors and the CASA volunteer examine the case and rate the status and level of risk of the child on a baseline scale along the three core dimensions of safety, permanency and well being. We are documenting in the database the initial assessment related to these dimensions; the advocacy goals and plans (steps and procedures to be implemented); the degree to which the plan is then implemented; and how the assessment of safety, permanency, and well-being measures changes over time. Through ETO, we will not only be able to track youth who are being served through the diversion program, but how the corresponding advocacy has impacted their lives.","Program Manager (80% of 1 FTE to manage program) - $24,000
 
 Advocate Supervisors (5% of 20FTEs - staff who support CASA volunteers on a daily basis throughout their case) - $57,200

Additionally, we will be applying to Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) and Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) funding for additional revenue. Currently, we have numerous five and six-figure requests pending to sustain the launch and support the work in subsequent years.","['Access to LA2050 community', 'Host public events on the topic your organizationâ€™s issue area (e.g. access to capital, education reform, clean energy, etc.) ', 'Communications support, including traditional media, social media, and LA2050 newsletter', 'Publicity/awareness', 'Capacity, including staff', 'Strategy assistance and implementation']","Los Angeles County is working to keep young people out of the juvenile delinquency system by providing â€œdiversionâ€ programs. However, youth in foster care are often excluded from these programs because they do not have a parent to oversee their participation. CASA/LA seeks to recruit and train 400 volunteers to serve as advocates for youth in the foster care system who are facing time in juvenile delinquency and who need a community volunteer so they may participate in these diversion programs.",['County of Los Angeles (please select only if your project has a countywide benefit)'],Pilot project (testing a new idea on a small scale to prove feasibility),"CASA volunteers frequently turn inspiration into impact. Whether they are helping a youth to avoid time in the delinquency system, supporting a child's medical or educational needs, or helping a youth in foster care to secure a permanent and loving home, our volunteers work everyday to turn a child's hopes into reality. CASA volunteers are key in helping youth develop essential life skills, connecting them with resources, navigating education, medical and legal appointments, and accessing employment and housing. 
 
 
 
 For many of our CASAs serving crossover youth (youth as they have pending cases in both the dependency care system (foster care) and juvenile delinquency), they might be the only person in the delinquency courtroom who truly knows the child. This happened last year in the case of a CASA youth who was accused of theft. When the youth went to court, he kept turning to his CASA to help him answer the questions. Finally, the judge asked who the person was, and the youth replied, ""That's my CASA.""
 
 
 
 When the judge realized the youth had a CASA volunteer, he deferred the case, noting that the youth had someone to guide him towards better decisions. For many youth in the dependency care system, they do not have such a person by their side, and the outcomes of their cases are not as fortunate. CASAs are the one person a youth can trust as they are consistent, caring, stable adults who are not paid to be there. For youth navigating the juvenile justice system, the CASA becomes a crucial lifeline through the judicial process. 
 
 
 
 Through the Diversion Volunteer program, more Angelenos will have the opportunity to stand by these youth, supporting them in the judicial process, and overseeing their court-ordered programs so that youth don't find themselves in the juvenile justice pipeline, greatly increasing their chances of adult incarceration, homelessness, and sadly for many young women (and men), sexual trafficking. CASAs can play an important role in diverting these tragic consequences and with the help of more Los Angeles community members, we can guide these youth toward better decisions.","CASA of Los Angeles will be working with Childrenâ€™s Law Center (CLC), LA County's Youth Diversion and Development Program (YDD), Los Angeles County Department of Children & Family Services (DCFS), and other community based organizations. CASA of Los Angeles frequently works in collaboration with other organizations as part of the CASA volunteer's role is to connect and families to community agencies and organizations that support youth in the foster care system to maneuver through whatever crisis or needs they are experiencing. Through the diversion program, CASA of Los Angeles will coordinate with multiple agencies to ensure the youth are participating in the diversion program, and that their case is being properly shepherded to success.",KMcGuiness@casala.org,Kristen McGuiness,323-859-2888,['Rates of volunteerism'],"['LA is the best place to LEARN', 'LA is the healthiest place to LIVE']",[],[],Non-profit organization,"['Yes, in 2014', 'Yes, in 2015', 'Yes, in 2016', 'Yes, in 2018']",https://www.facebook.com/CASAofLA/,@casa.la,@casaofla,https://www.casala.org,https://www.facebook.com/CASAofLA/,@casa.la,@casaofla,https://www.casala.org,https://vimeo.com/138053078,['LA2050 newsletter'],21-50 employees,No,,[],[],[],[],Monterey Park,"201 Centre Plaza Drive, Suite 1100",95-3890446,Â CASA of Los AngelesÂ,California,91754,[],[],,http://casala.org/donate-money/,http://casala.org/volunteer/,Help Keep Youth in Foster Care Out of Juvenile Delinquency,LA is the best place to CONNECT,$1 million +,"According to a 2018 study conducted by USC's Child Data Network, four out of five LA probation youth have received at least one child welfare referral for suspected maltreatment, with many experiencing their first referral early in childhood. These youth are frequently called crossover youth as they have pending cases in both the dependency care system (foster care) and juvenile delinquency. They also have higher rates of unemployment, adult incarceration, and homelessness. 
 
 
 
 CASA of Los Angeles' mission is to mobilize community volunteers to advocate for children in the Los Angeles County child welfare system who have experienced abuse and neglect. It is well-documented that child welfare struggles with racial, ethnic, and economic equity. CASA/LA has long recognized these disparities, and has worked to not only serve more children in care in order to ameliorate the consequences of economic, racial and ethnic disparities in the children and families we serve, but to prepare our community volunteers to support the establishment of more equitable opportunities for children and youth within the child welfare system and in life.
 
 
 
 Los Angeles Countyâ€™s Youth Diversion and Development Office is implementing a comprehensive youth diversion model to link youth with community-based organizations that support their development, in lieu of an arrest or citation. Unfortunately, youth in foster care are not able to participate in this program unless a parent or guardian can monitor their participation.
 
 
 
 CASA hopes to fill this gap by training and appoint LA community members as advocates for these youth so they can participate in diversion programs. These volunteers will supervise and monitor youthâ€™s participation in their diversion programs by advocating for access to services, supporting youth in navigating challenges with community based organizations (requests to change provider, address conflicts, etc.), addressing barriers to successful completion of the diversion plan (e.g., transportation), monitoring progress within the program, and coordinating between various parties on youthâ€™s team. Through LA2050, CASA/LA will recruit and train 400 volunteers to serve this specific group of youth.
 
 
 
 CASA is in the early stages of developing the program, reaching out to current CASA volunteers to develop best practices, and working directly with the LA Dependency Court judicial officers to determine the best strategies for referral and assignment of CASA volunteers to crossover cases. CASA anticipates developing the training for this program over the summer of 2019, with a program to launch by mid-fall.
 
 
 
 Through this program, more youth would avoid juvenile convictions through the assignment of a CASA volunteer, so they may participate in diversion programs, providing LA community members the opportunity to help youth in foster care avoid the juvenile justice system, and live happier, healthier, more equitable lives.",,,,,Active,CONNECT,,,Voting Period,

However, these issues arenâ€™t unique to Hollywoodâ€”examinations of hierarchies from government to finance to tech also reflect the problem of power concentrated in the hands of a non-representative minority. In recognizing that diversifying content is good for the marketplace and society, we have an opportunity to engage companies in this very intentional cultural shift. Those that sign on to support and hire the participants in CCI will make their commitment visible. We are eager to work with HR departments and other leaders to take a deep dive into which barriers continue to face the elevation of women of color in these corporations, and also publicize the progress we make through the program to create added pressure for the industry to catch up to the times.","There are a number of critical organizations and partnerships supporting underrepresented students to gain access to entertainment careers, whose work we aim to supplement. Programs like Ghetto Film Schoolâ€™s Roster, The Hollywood Reporterâ€™s Young Executive Fellowship, Big Brothers Big Sisters LA Women In Entertainment Mentorship Program, the Academy Gold Program, Inner-City Filmmakers, and others have all made incredible impact in the lives of students and emerging professionals. We look forward to collaborating with them and learning how we can help the continuation of their efforts. 
 
 
 
 Because of the concentration on an initial smaller group of participants, our objective is to provide tailored, comprehensive support for each student in understanding and meeting their professional needs. As WIF has learned through 20 years of providing mentorship, building a career in the industry takes talent, a community of support, and time. Moreover, entry into the industry requires access and resources often unavailable to those limited by income or region. CCI is designed to account for the wide range of factors needed to ensure a studentâ€™s success, including ongoing individualized guidance from internship applications through internships themselves and then job interviews, providing real understanding and navigation of industry structure, and overcoming bias within the companies through the company training component. Over time, the goal would be to create evergreen best practices and replicable program guides to make these resources available to students everywhere.
 
 
 
 That there is a multiplicity of professional programs, and still not enough resources for all Los Angelesâ€™ students to have consistent and upwardly-mobile work opportunities, is a testament that we should not be in competition with one another, but continuing to build a coalition that provides for our communitiesâ€™ underrepresented and underserved. Collaborating with The CSUEA and these other organizational partners also means that we can together â€œdo more, betterâ€ to enhance and not unnecessarily duplicate existing programs and efforts.","Our evaluation will be based on feedback from participants on how the program elevated their confidence and abilities, the number of interviews and meetings arranged within program parameters, and ultimately any resulting hires. We will also be tracking the number of companies signed on to take the hiring trainings, and how many new candidates from underrepresented backgrounds, and any CCI participants, they interview and ultimately hire. Again, because we know this type of preparation canâ€™t be complete within a year, we anticipate a 100% success rate in securing job interviews and general meetings, and would aim for a 10% hire rate (or 3 participants) within the first year. Following this first program year, we would like to develop a CCI Alumni Program that continues to not only supports program grads but also ensure they can support each other while paying it forward to become future CCI mentors to the next generation of locally-based industry leaders.","Project Manager, P/T  35000

What resulted was a distribution deal from Netflix and an introduction to a bigger digital aggregator. The film was the first Pakistani film to be on Netflix, be in the permanent selection of the Library of Congress and 3 years later, it is still running in festivals and on SVOD platforms around the world. It was more than the money that made the Finishing Funding so important. It was the symbolism. What we needed desperately then was validation. Women In Filmâ€™s â€˜yesâ€™ broke the pattern of â€˜noâ€™s.â€™ In a lot of ways, that was both the tipping point of the journey of the film - and for me - in the business.

 The size and diversity of the CSU student population are profound. In 2017, 484,297 students attended 23 campuses across the State with 127,366 of them in Los Angeles County. 21 of 23 CSU campuses are Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) with at least a 25% Latinx student enrollment. CSU students largely come from California and mostly remain in the state after graduation, applying the skills and knowledge they have learned to help Californiaâ€™s economy thrive. Nearly 13,000 Cal State students are annually working towards entertainment arts and media focused degrees.
 
  
 
 However, even with this kind of early support, across the entertainment industry and ascending its chains of command, women of color remain underrepresented in all positions, especially positions of power. According to 2017 US Census Data, the City of Los Angeles is 50% women, and 72% communities of color. And in a telling example of the LA student population, CSULA is comprised of 58% women students and 94% students of color. In the 2019 report, â€œInclusion in the Directorâ€™s Chairâ€ by USC Annenbergâ€™s Inclusion Initiative, data show that at the executive levels of the six largest entertainment companies, women make up only 23% of leadership (across C-suite, boards, and executive film teams) and women of color, 5%. 
 
 
 
 The initial CCI cohort of 30 women students will be selected through The CSUEAâ€™s internship program and have a demonstrated interest in an executive career path. CCI will begin its curriculum design process in the early Fall of 2019 for both the workshops for students and trainings for companies. Student workshops will include basic skill building such as resumes and interviewing for entertainment, but also issues prioritized by WIF such as understanding gender bias and confidence building. Participant applications will open in late Fall, with the aim of selecting participants for the beginning of Spring semester 2020. The program for students will formally take place over one year. By the end of one year, participants will be equipped with a deep skill set to help them excel at interviews and internships, and will have had opportunities to put these skill set to use. Company trainings will be planned for a 2020 start as well, informed and partially delivered by CCI student participants, and delivered to companies partnering with The CSUEA.",,,Active,CREATE,,,Voting Period,
9760644693,H.I.P Through Science,The People of Change offers programs to promote advancement opportunities for community members through community-based initiatives in areas of Education Economic Empowerment and Cultural Awareness.,"One of our biggest barriers as with most nonprofit organizations is funding. Currently our most consistent source besides small grants and fundraising efforts source has been through Lyft and Uber driving, which has its toll on time. More funding for a volunteer manager means more programs, more program hours, and more program participants. Our current strategy in getting over this hurdle is to continue doing fundraisers and events to raise money to support our STEM program. 
 
 
 
 Another barrier has been to convince parents in extremely impoverished areas that STEM education is valuable, many parents in our urban areas value sports over education and invest more time in Saturday and afterschool sports than education. So showing and even sometime persuading parents that education should take priority has been. We generally combat that hurdle by showing parents how much their child learned and is interested in STEM. Parent participation and involvement is a component of our annual science fair scoring.
 
 Another challenge is that we currently operate out of a home office in North Hollywood and must haul supplies to and from these sites, a round-trip commute of over 70 miles. Making printouts for the STEM sites is hard on a limited budget, with little office space. We are currently looking to partner with local agencies for office space in the communities we serve to address that issue. To keep up with the ever-changing scientific developments, we must continue to purchase new tools such as microscopes, computer software, math books and experiment kits. This is a huge but necessary cost. We are being very cost-efficient when it comes to purchasing material.",The only other known STEM program is Saturday Science Academy. Their program isn't year round and is doesn't service children in the immediate community. Where as HIP Through Science targets children in the Watts and surrounding communities. we also service a lot more students continually. Its Good community program in the community making impact also.,"The measures of our success will be measured through a variety of methods. We will have quarterly quizzes that will be assigned and given out to each site to find out what educational points need to be improved on. We will track the improvements and our goal will be to have each child improve test scores and be STEM ready to meet state-wide testing requirements. HIP Through Science surveys will be given out also quarterly to determine and measure the interest gained while attending sessions. Information will be provided on such topics as what are the STEM field careers that they are familiar with before and after, what type of STEM careers relate to what they would like to do in life. Our Annual HIP Through Science Fair has a community pillar for some years now; we have doubled our number of participants each year and community attendance since our first. We will continue to measure the attendance of our future science fairs. Our success will also be measured by our youthsâ€™ willingness to participate in sessions and having the confidence to read in front of other peers in each session.

Of course you had your pick of sports programs and teams to pick from but, when it came to any educational STEM programs to harness the skills of any kids interested the choices were obsolete. I thank my mother for purchasing small science kits as a child for me to experiment and be a mad scientist in my makeshift bath room laboratory. One big inspiration or mentor of sorts to many kids growing up in my generation is Bill Nye the Science guy his witty comedy and Science experiments furthered inspired a generation of science enthusiast. 
 
 Attending a University that lacked diversity was a complete shell shock especially when it came to STEM classes, being in classes with people from cultures I've only seen on tv was quite the experience. It became a burden when in our STEM labs (As a pre-med then geology then major at the time) no one wanted to partner up with me even in some instances some would triple up with a duo instead of partnering with me often times I'd partner with the professor or do a lab by myself. I ended switching after 3 years out of the STEM field major as a whole and graduated with African American Studies and Sociology.
 
 After moving to California from the East Coast my first job was as a Community Organizer in South LA (SPA 6) as a grassroots organizer for 3 years I noticed one of the obvious figures in poverty was education and lack of programs that provide quality relatable education. I started a small pilot STEM program watts which was well received and it allowed me to see first hand just how bad the educational problem is the community I was serving. I reached out to a few other local community leaders and we started a non profit focused on education, income, cultural awareness and health. This is where HIP Through Science was birthed. Out of the need for quality relatable STEM education in South LA, since its inception we have served the community and are inspiring 1,000's yearly. We will continue to upgrade our methods and tools and we hope that with your help we can deliver to and help cater to the children that wasn't to learn STEM!","The East Side Riders Bike Club will provide bike learning tools, bikes also showing the healthy and safe ways of bike riding which hasn't been done before in south Los Angeles.

With its own members rooting from underrepresented communities, they themselves saw the benefits and possibilities for others to enter the digital world. The missing piece was finding someone who could bring the message to those individuals in the community. 
 
 Within the first few weeks of its establishment, ADDI found its individual that could spread the message. Peter, who would be the Executive director of the nonprofit, decided to take the challenge in structuring the organization. Peter's higher education background made for an easy transition into the nonprofit world. The hard part was deciding in what direction for ADDI to go. As you have seen, underrepresented groups of any age, make up a low percentage in the digital world. 
 
 Peter decided to draw from his own experience, the same motivation that led him towards higher education. As a first generation Latino entering college, the transition from high school to college was difficult. Decisions on what path to head towards and not necessarily knowing what to major enroll in, Peter could only rely on his average academic success in high school to support whatever decision to take. Unfortunately, Peter and like many first generation students, the transition into college came at a cost of struggling academically and being suspended for poor academics.
 
 With having no skill set to fall back on, Peter bounced from minimum wage jobs for years. Finally Peter, was able to go back to school and earn his bachelors, and his masters there after. Peter knew from that point his mission was to support and guide youth by preparing them for the obstacles of the real world which could lead them to possibles successes or failures. 
 
 ADDI's ""A Personal Invitation"" Project is Peter's vision of first educating and preparing high school students for a type of career/skill, computer programming, that can pave a successful way of life whether you earn a degree or not.

Despite Black, Latinx, American & Native Pacific Islander makeup nearly 50% of the United States student population, in 2015 they only represented just 17% of computer science major (Steinglass, 2017). The reason most of these students are not in computer science is not due to lack of interest but due to the lack of resources & awareness.

9856862494,Venice Community Housing,"To reduce homelessness, maximize affordable housing, empower low-income people, provide social services, & advocate for policy that strengthens the economic, racial & cultural diversity of Venice.","As VCH continues to expand and develop affordable housing on the Westside of Los Angeles, significant community resistance continues to surface. Fight Back Venice and other â€œNot In My Backyardâ€ (NIMBY) groups have formed to actively oppose permanent supportive housing and affordable housing developments, which are central to VCHâ€™s mission. While the organization does not anticipate opposition directly to the art installments, it is possible that these neighborhood groups could create challenges because they oppose the organizationâ€™s overall work. 
 
 
 
 VCH has several strategies in place to overcome such opposition. The hope is that the murals and art installations themselves will change the stigma around permanent supportive housing, and create a new narrative around design. VCH wants to demonstrate that affordable and homeless housing can be beautiful, well designed, and connect art and architecture. 
 
 
 
 VCH expects to be able to continue a high level of community engagement and education, which the organization has already been doing in preparation for other housing developments. Community engagement manifests itself through community meetings, with a focus on educating community members on the facts versus myths around homelessness. VCH supporters in Venice host small dinner gatherings in which they invite their neighbors, and VCH staff attends to answer their questions and concerns about upcoming developments. VCH will continue this format of community engagement, as well as incorporating additional community meetings that focus specifically on each art installation project. During these meetings, tenants and community members can give feedback on the design and concepts of each art project.","While there are other organizations providing services to unhoused people in Venice, like Safe Place For Youth (SPY) and St. Josephâ€™s Center, VCH is the only nonprofit housing developer in Venice. It is a one-stop-shop for acquisitions, developments, property management, and resident services. As a result, the organization can engage the community at a deeper level because it can take ownership for all aspects of the buildings it owns and operates. 
 
 
 
 Social and Public Art Resource Center (SPARC) is another organization doing similar art programing in Venice. SPARCâ€™s mission is to â€œexamine what we choose to memorialize through public art, to devise and innovate excellent art pieces; and ultimately, to provide empowerment through participatory processes to residents and communities excluded from civic debate. SPARCâ€™s works are never simply individually authored endeavors, but rather a collaboration between artists and communities, resulting in art which rises from within the community, rather than being imposed upon it.â€ Additionally, SPY has a healing arts program, which provides homeless youth with a safe space for creative expression, where they can use art as a way to support their social and mental wellness. VCHâ€™s art installation project is unique from these two programs because the focus is on art and design as it related to affordable housing developments.","Success will be defined by creating art installations on 4 of VCHâ€™s properties by summer of 2020. VCH will measure this by monitoring that the hired artists complete their projects in the given timeframe, that each project has 2 community engagement meetings prior to beginning the art installation, and by gaining at least 300 supporters for its supportive and affordable housing developments, as measured by the submission of support letters. 
 
 
 
 VCH will also measure the success of each event by developing a set of â€œLessonâ€™s Learnedâ€ at the completion of each installation. This will provide insight on what worked, what didnâ€™t work and what can be improved on in order to make the next art installation even better.","Art Installation Budget

Tito has lived in Venice since 1963 when Venice was a much different place than it is now. While Venice is gentrifying at a rapid rate, Tito says this is not a new fight. In the â€™80s-â€˜90s he saw many friends and family members evicted from their homes. Tito advocated for affordable housing in the â€˜90s by attending marches and demonstrations. At the same time, Tito faced his own struggles with drug addiction. He recounted his trips to county rehabilitation facilities, with relapses in between, recalling that the final time he went to rehab and got clean, â€œI was surprised I wasnâ€™t dead already.â€ As Tito struggled with his sobriety, he also found himself living on the street. He described these conditions as leaving him to feel â€œnot even like a human being.â€ 
 
 
 
 In 2005, Tito was connected to VCH and secured permanent supportive housing. He admitted that he has â€œsurvivorsâ€™ guiltâ€, because there are so many people still on the street suffering â€“ many who are people he grew up with in Venice and has known since childhood. Tito said he feels incredible grateful for his housing, even for the simple things like a place to wash dishes and take a shower.
 
 
 
 Tito is also a well-known Venice artist. He knew he had artistic talent since in elementary school, and recalls creating finger paintings of cowboys that he saw on television. Tito went on to be a multimedia artist as an adult. He laments that Venice is not the artist community it once was, as most artists have been pushed out because of soaring housing costs. As a result, he feels â€œthe flavor of Venice has become bland.â€ He notes that while there are some artists here in Venice, many are not true Venetians, but rather wealthier people coming from other parts of LA. 
 
 
 
 Titoâ€™s is one of the faces that will be featured on VCHâ€™s first mural on Lincoln Blvdâ€“ Titoâ€™s home for the last 14 years. As a longtime resident of Venice and tenant with VCH, and an artist with a unique look and style, Tito was an obvious choice for someone VCH wants to honor and memorialize through public art.","While VCH does not have a partner organization in this project, it will partner with different local artists for each art installation. The artist will be selected through a Request For Qualification process and be expected to create a concept that promotes VCHâ€™s mission. She or he will also be required to engage the community and the tenants living in that particular VCH building. The expectation is that the artist will receive input from tenants and community members, and incorporate their feedback in the refinement of the mural/art installation design. 
 
 
 
 This project is also guided by members of an external committee, many of whom come from other Venice nonprofit and arts organizations. Some of these organizations include Safe Place For Youth, Beyond Baroque, Venice Arts Council, and 18th Street Arts Center.",akadlac@vchcorp.org,Alie Kadlac,310-573-8406,[],[],"['Employment in the creative industries', 'Arts establishments per capita', 'Measures of cultural and global economic influence (â€œsoft powerâ€)']","['LA is the best place to CONNECT', 'LA is the healthiest place to LIVE']",Non-profit organization,['No'],"Ivo Vergara: www.facebook.com/ivo.lasnibat

ArtsC2 will further VCHâ€™s advocacy strategies by incorporating art projects into existing and new housing developments. VCH tenants and program participants will give feedback on design and participate in the creation of art. Through art installations, ArtsC2 hopes to highlight that the formerly homeless who now live in supportive housing care about their homes and take pride in contributing to their community. 
 
 
 
 Participants of Venice YouthBuild, one of VCHâ€™s programs, will also assist with art installations. YouthBuild provides 18-24 youth from low-income and underserved backgrounds with education, job training, and leadership development. All participants are AmeriCorps members and their work on this project will count towards their required AmeriCorps hours. 
 
 
 
 ArtsC2 includes external committee members, many of whom come from other organizations, such as Beyond Baroque, 18th Street Arts, and Venice Arts Council. A Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will be the primary tool to identify and hire local artists. Other tactics include inviting community members to participate in creating art and hosting unveiling celebrations at the completion of each project. Community engagement strategies include building relationships with artists and art organizations, hosting tenant meetings to get feedback on art concepts, and canvasing in surrounding neighborhoods with information about the projects. 
 
 
 
 VCHâ€™s first mural will take place at a building that includes housing for 13 formerly chronically homeless individuals. VCH hired artist Ivo Vergara, who has created a design that features portraits of Venice natives, community activists, and VCH tenants. 
 
 
 
 VCH serves over 1,300 individuals annually. This includes homeless and low-income adults, youth, and children living in the communities of Venice, Mar Vista and Del Rey. 100% of those served by VCH are low-income. More than 30% of current tenants have experienced homelessness prior to residing with VCH. Public art installations will also serve the greater community and the nearly 30,000 tourist who visit Venice Beach on a daily basis (City of LA Dept. of Rec. and Parks). 
 
 
 
 VCHâ€™s first mural will begin mid-April. The timeline for art installations on 4 additional buildings will be as follows: May: Distribute RFQ and compile list of potential artists. July: Finalize artist selection and begin community engagement for Project #1 at 4215 Centinela Ave. Aug â€“ Sept.: Artist creates installation and unveiling party. Oct. - Dec: Repeat process for Project #2, at 102 Navy St. Feb-April: Repeat preparation process for Project #3, at 4429 Inglewood Blvd. May-July: Repeat preparation process for Project #4, at 920 Sixth Ave.
 
 
 
 VCH will work towards the following goals: Add additional members to ArtsC2; Complete art installations on schedule; Identify and gather at least 300 permanent and affordable housing supporters.",,,Active,CREATE,,,Voting Period,
