  Welcome to the
  <span class="avoid-break">2019 My LA2050</span>
  <span class="avoid-break">Grants Challenge</span>
</h2>

LA2050 is a community-guided initiative driving and tracking progress toward a shared vision for the future of Los Angeles. With the support of 30,000 Angelenos, we’ve outlined an aspirational vision centered on five goals and 60+ metrics tracked over time to evaluate how Los Angeles is faring. <br /><br /><strong>The My LA2050 Grants Challenge is an open call for ideas to make LA the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live.<br /><br />A total of $1,000,000</strong> will be awarded among 10 organizations to implement their proposals. Each organization will receive a total of $100,000 and [partnership from LA2050](/about/#la2050-partnership) to support its efforts.

<strong>Now, we're asking for your help to turn the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals) into action.</strong>

## Winners Selection

Winners will be selected via a two-step process:

**50 finalists will be selected by public vote**: The public will vote on all approved submissions to the grants challenge. Public vote will surface the top 10 finalists in each goal category.

**10 winning proposals will be selected by an internal jury**: Goldhirsh Foundation board and staff will select the winners from the 50 finalists. Two proposals in each goal category will be announced as the winners.

Winners will be selected using the following criteria:

* Impact on the [LA2050 goals and metrics](/about/#goals)
* Overall quality of the application
* Feasibility
* Ability to mobilize the LA community
* Collaborative spirit
